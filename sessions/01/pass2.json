A mix-up with meal orders drew Bazgar, Marwen Ashcroft, and the veiled elf Sabriel together at one table, where they introduced themselves and compared backgrounds and skills. The trio reviewed the inn’s writ board and chose the time-sensitive “Border Patrol — Undead Sighting” job, then asked the barkeep Thorgrim Ledger-Scar for directions to Renn Caldor at the Eastern Patrol watchtower. Sabriel paid Thorgrim to stable their pony (with extra cost for “whole grains”), and the new party set out toward the eastern hills.",

A botched set of plates became an excuse to share a table, trade names, and quietly measure one another’s usefulness, until the writ board’s sealed notice about undead on the eastern road pulled them into common purpose. With Thorgrim’s blunt directions and a freshly paid stable fee, the three stepped back into Ardenford’s morning wind and started climbing toward the watchtower.",

        "Bazgar": "Reveals his impatience and ambition, arguing that big goals require bigger risks, but ultimately accepts the group’s plan to start smaller and build toward greater ruins."
