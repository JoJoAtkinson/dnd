At this point it’s probably no secret that I use LLMs a lot when I’m building out this campaign content. I’m guessing each of you has your own feelings about that, which totally makes sense.

Hopefully you all love R2-D2 and C-3PO as much as I do: and that how i see the LLMs, as helpful droids which I use to to support my content managment. 

##  What’s mine vs what’s the tool

My creativity still drives the world, the plot, the twists, the NPC motives, and the “what happens next.” The LLM is mostly a helper for turning my messy first draft into something readable.

If you’ve ever seen how I take notes, you know the raw version is basically “Joe-ese”: quick, out of order, and arguably another language. The LLM helps me translate that into plain English.

If I say "something needs review", that is my way of staying I didn't constrain the agent, which can be though of as a LLM acting like C-3PO and translanting without contraints or targeted instructions. 

Moving foward, I'll be clear here and say "this was generated content." when the C-3PO was used more then just simple translation. 

# About mistakes and “gotchas”

If you spot an inconsistency or something weird, please call it out the same way you always would. Just assume it’s my oversight unless I’ve labeled that section Needs review.

A couple “AI mistakes” that got flagged so far were actually just me being human. 

Thanks for rolling with my process. It genuinely means a lot to me, and I’m excited to keep building this world with you all.
