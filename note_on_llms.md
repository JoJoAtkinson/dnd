## Note on feedback (and LLMs)

Hey friends — quick note about my writing and how you give feedback.

I genuinely want critique. Be blunt. Be picky. If something is confusing, clunky, inconsistent with the world, or just reads badly, I want to know. That’s how this gets better.

One thing that would really help: treating everything here as my writing, regardless of tools.

I know it can be confusing when LLMs are involved, so here's my process: I write the raw material, then use an LLM mostly to restructure it (flow, clarity, organization, wording), and then I decide what to keep, what to change, and what to share with you. The ideas, world-building, and storytelling are mine—the tool just helps me organize my thoughts into something more readable.

What this means for feedback: please respond to what's on the page, not to what you think a tool might have done. If something feels off, I want to know—that's on me to fix, not on the LLM. And if you're ever holding back because you're not sure where to direct your critique, just aim it at the page itself. That's where I need it most.

### What’s helpful

- Quote the line/section and tell me what’s not working (unclear, awkward, doesn’t fit the tone, contradicts lore, etc.).
- Tell me what you expected instead, or what you want more/less of.
- If it’s just “off,” say that — but anchor it in a reason (voice, pacing, vibe, logic).

### What doesn't help as much

- Holding back on critique because you're unsure about the tool's role
- Treating sections differently based on whether they "feel like AI"

I get why that instinct exists—I really do. But for me, it's all just "my writing" at this point, and I need the same level of honesty across the board.

(If you want to talk more about my process or tools sometime, I'm always happy to—I just want to keep that conversation separate from critiquing the actual content.)

Thanks for caring enough to read this stuff and help me shape it. I’m lucky to have you.
