## Description

> A weighty book with a plain, well-kept cover. On the front is an inlaid symbol: a sharp starburst of light radiating from a single point. When opened, every page looks blank—no ink, no indentations, no hidden script—yet the book feels important in a way that’s hard to shake.

The volume lacks a title on the spine and bears no library stamp, shelf-mark, or catalog notation. Under any light (candle, sun, moon), the pages remain frustratingly empty. Even when writing is applied, it fails to persist: ink fades, chalk smears into nothing, and pressed pencil leaves no lasting impression.

## Properties & Mechanics

### Observed Properties

- **Blank pages:** The pages appear blank to everyone who has examined it so far.
- **Writing refuses to remain:** Attempts to mark the pages do not persist.
- **Conjuration aura:** Detect Magic reveals a strong **conjuration** presence suffusing the book.
- **Ownership impression:** When first presented to Sabriel, the book provoked an immediate sense of *belonging* (“this is your book”), though no clear bond or command word has been identified.

### Unconfirmed / Unknown

- Whether the symbol corresponds to a known god, saint, celestial order, or cult.
- Whether the book contains hidden text, an extradimensional “true” contents, or serves as a key/anchor to something else.
- Whether it is safe to keep, to read aloud from, or to bring near holy sites.

## History & Lore

This book was discovered in the stacks of the **Concordance Library** in Ardenford—yet it was **not in the catalog**, and no one present could identify its origin. The lack of records is as unsettling as the magic itself.
