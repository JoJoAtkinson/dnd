# Vorzug Dakmar'nak (VOR-zug DAHK-mar-nak) — “Ledger-Scar”

Vorzug is a Dakmar'nak engineer who learned (the hard way) that in Garhammar, a man who cannot read the language of contracts can be made into one.

## Identity

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Race** | Orc (Dakmar'nak tribe) |
| **Role** | Bridgewright / smith’s helper / labor advocate |
| **Alignment** | Neutral Good |
| **Location** | [Ardenford](../locations/ardenford.md) |
| **Affiliation** | Rakthok Horde (Dakmar'nak); Ardenhaven (resident-in-good-standing, pending) |
| **Languages** | Orcish (fluent), Common (serviceable), Dwarven (basic; learned from Bazgar) |

## Appearance

Lean and long-armed for an orc, with careful hands stained by pitch and iron-black. A pale band of scar tissue circles his wrists where Garhammar shackles once sat—his “ledger-scar”. He keeps his tusks filed short (a craftsman’s habit), and wears a simple cord necklace bearing a stamped brass tag from the labor camp he refuses to throw away.

## Personality

- **Traits:** Watchful, patient, literal-minded about promises; speaks softly until cornered.
- **Ideals:** A spoken oath is breath; a written oath is stone. If you cannot read the stone, it will bury you.
- **Bonds:** Owes a life-debt to Bazgar; still considers himself answerable to the Dakmar'nak Fire Council.
- **Flaws:** Prideful about competence; resents being treated as “muscle” and can turn coldly sarcastic.

## Background

### Captured by the Garhammar Trade League

Vorzug was taken during a trade-route sweep near a mountain pass. He couldn’t speak Dwarven, and the League’s foremen treated his silence as guilt. Without an advocate, he was “processed” into hard labor—shackled, numbered, and put to work hauling ore and turning winches until his wrists bled.

Garhammar dwarves weren’t trying to be cruel in their own telling. They were being “correct”: the papers said the labor was lawful, and without language, Vorzug couldn’t challenge the papers.

### Freed by Bazgar

When Bazgar Dakmar'nak passed through the same valley, he recognized Vorzug as a “brother” of the tribe—kin by hearth and oath, not blood. Bazgar spoke Dwarven, demanded an arbiter, and forced the foremen to produce the contract that supposedly bound Vorzug.

It didn’t exist.

Under League rules, the mistake was simple: no contract, no claim. The foremen grumbled, the arbiter signed, and Vorzug was allowed to leave.

### Why He Went to Ardenford (and Why He Stayed)

Vorzug didn’t follow Bazgar to become an adventurer. He followed because he’d learned another kind of battlefield existed—one made of span and load, counterweight and tension—and the Dakmar'nak are raised to fight with craft as well as steel.

He came to Ardenford for three honorable reasons:

1. **To learn what makes great works stand:** Ardenford’s towers and bridges aren’t just pride—they’re lessons in how timber and stone carry their own weight. Vorzug wants that knowledge so the Dakmar'nak can build war engines that don’t tear themselves apart when they sling giant boulders.
2. **To learn without being handed secrets:** He doesn’t expect Ardenford to teach an outsider siegecraft outright. So he takes honest work on the Fordspine Bridgeworks, watches how masters brace spans and set anchors, and practices until the principles are his.
3. **To make his freedom un-stealable:** Ardenhaven’s courts and Council petitions give him a record that even Garhammar respects. A filed complaint and a stamped writ make it harder for the League to “lose” him again—and gives him standing if anyone tries.

## Current Role in Ardenford

- Finds work as day laborer on bridge repairs who is rapidly becoming the foreman’s “problem-solver” for ironwork that keeps failing in winter damp.
