# Western Scrubland Ruins (Old Keep)

> Crumbling stone foundations and a hidden cave entrance where ancient walls meet wild scrubland—recently cleared of goblin raiders.

- **Location:** ~3 miles southwest of Ardenford, in rocky scrubland
- **Type:** Small ruin complex with cave lair
- **Age:** Pre-Ardenhaven (likely Age of Rhodes or earlier)
- **Current Status:** Recently cleared of goblins (early winter 4250 AF)
- **Danger Level:** Low (CR 1-2 encounters possible)
- **Faction:** Technically [Ardenhaven](../_overview.md) territory, but unclaimed

## Overview

What locals call "the old ruins" is actually the remains of a small fortified structure—possibly a watchtower or border keep from a long-dead civilization. Only the foundations remain above ground: low walls of fitted stone, mostly collapsed, with scattered rubble marking where rooms once stood.

The real feature of interest is a **small cave entrance** hidden among collapsed stones on the site's western edge. This natural cave, possibly expanded or worked by whoever built the original structure, served as a lair for a small goblin warband until recently.

The location sits in a transitional zone where the [grassy foothills](grassy-foothills.md) give way to rockier scrubland. Boulders and thorny brush provide natural cover, and the terrain's rough enough that casual travelers avoid it.

## Geography & Layout

### Above Ground

**Ruin Foundations**
- Rectangular layout, roughly 40 x 30 feet
- Walls only 2-3 feet high in most places, crumbled to rubble in others
- Fitted stone construction (no mortar)—shows skilled masonry
- No roof or upper structure remains
- Some interior walls suggest multiple rooms originally

**Terrain**
- Rocky scrubland with scattered boulders (some large enough to hide behind)
- Low brush, thorny plants, patches of hardy grass
- Uneven ground; loose stones create difficult terrain in places
- Low visibility at dusk when shadows deepen

**Collapsed Entrance**
- Western edge of the ruins
- Pile of large stones that appear natural but hide the cave entrance beneath
- Entrance is only 3-4 feet high; requires crouching or crawling
- Difficult to spot from a distance (DC 15 Perception to notice if you're not specifically searching)

### The Cave Lair

**Main Chamber**
- Natural cave, roughly 25 x 20 feet
- Ceiling height: 6-8 feet (taller than expected)
- Walls show some tool marks—possibly worked to expand the space
- Small fire pit in center (now cold and abandoned)
- Crude ventilation—smoke can escape through cracks

**Features (as found after goblin occupation):**
- Gnawed bones scattered about (sheep, small animals, some human-sized that might be old adventurers)
- Crude bedrolls made from stolen fabric and wool
- Stolen goods: farming tools, lanterns, a child's toy
- Evidence of recent habitation but now abandoned

**Back Area**
- Narrow passage leads to smaller chamber
- Used by goblins as a pen for stolen sheep
- Natural water seepage keeps it damp
- Low ceiling (5 feet); uncomfortable for Medium creatures

## History

### Ancient Past

The original structure dates to a time when this region was more densely populated. Based on construction style, possibly built during the **Age of Rhodes** (~3400-3600 AF) when numerous small settlements dotted Ardenhaven's territory.

**Purpose (speculation):**
- Border watchtower or signal station
- Shepherd's shelter with defensive features
- Minor noble's hunting lodge
- Way station on a now-forgotten trade route

The structure was abandoned long ago—centuries at least. Nature and time have reclaimed most of it, leaving only foundations and the cave beneath.

### Recent Goblin Occupation

**Timeline:**
- Goblins moved in approximately 2-3 months ago (late autumn 4250 AF)
- Small warband (5 individuals) led by a slightly larger goblin with a scimitar
- Began raiding nearby farms for sheep, supplies, and anything shiny
- Escalated over three nights, targeting Maren Redwick's farm most aggressively

**The Raid Pattern:**
- Struck at dusk when visibility dropped
- Used hit-and-run tactics: scatter flock, grab 2-3 sheep, flee to ruins
- Threw rocks and javelins at anyone who pursued
- Dragged stolen sheep back to the cave to butcher

**Confrontation (resolved by adventurers):**
- Party approached at sunset to negotiate
- Negotiations broke down; combat ensued
- Goblins defeated; at least one fled after surrendering briefly
- Some sheep recovered alive and returned to Redwick Farm
- No goblins remain in the ruins (as of session 1)

## Current State (Post-Goblin)

The ruins are now **abandoned** but not yet claimed or repurposed:

**Evidence of Recent Activity:**
- Scattered goblin gear (broken weapons, torn leather)
- Fire pit still contains charcoal and bones
- Sheep wool caught on cave walls
- Blood stains near the entrance (already fading)
- Tracks leading away (goblins who fled)

**Potential Future Uses:**
- Could be claimed by another group of creatures
- Farmers might collapse the cave entrance to prevent future occupation
- Adventurers might use it as a camp when traveling this area
- Local authorities could post guards or seal it

## Atmosphere & Sensory Details

**Approaching at Dusk (as party did):**
- Long shadows from boulders create pools of darkness
- Rocky terrain makes stealth difficult (loose stones underfoot)
- Wind picks up as sun sets; temperature drops
- Smell of old smoke and decay near the cave entrance
- Distant bleating of sheep from [Redwick Farm](grassy-foothills.md)

**Inside the Cave:**
- Damp, earthy smell mixed with old smoke
- Darkness beyond the entrance (requires light source)
- Sound echoes strangely—difficult to judge space
- Cold but sheltered from wind
- Smell of rotting meat and unwashed goblin (when occupied)

**After the Fight:**
- Smell of blood and burned flesh (from fire spells)
- Scattered weapon debris
- Oppressive silence after the chaos of combat
- Relief mixed with wariness (is it truly over?)

## Tactical Considerations

### Defensibility

**For Attackers (entering the ruins):**
- Difficult terrain favors defenders
- Low visibility at dusk creates ambush opportunities
- Cave entrance is a choke point
- Limited room to maneuver inside the cave

**For Defenders (holding the ruins):**
- Boulders provide cover for ranged attacks
- Can retreat into cave if overwhelmed above ground
- Multiple escape routes (collapsed walls, terrain)
- Home ground advantage (know the terrain)

### Combat Environment

- **Difficult terrain:** Loose stones, uneven ground (half movement)
- **Cover:** Numerous boulders (half cover to three-quarters cover)
- **Lighting:** Varies by time of day; disadvantage on Perception in dim light
- **Escape routes:** Multiple directions; hard to surround completely

## Points of Interest

### The Stone Walls

The quality of the masonry suggests skilled builders. Each stone is carefully shaped to fit without mortar—a technique associated with dwarven construction or highly organized human settlements.

Some stones bear faint markings: weather-worn symbols that might be maker's marks, unit insignia, or decorative elements. A scholar might learn something from studying them.

### The Cave System

The cave appears natural but shows signs of expansion or modification. Tool marks on the walls suggest someone (long ago) widened passages or smoothed the floor.

**Unanswered Questions:**
- Does the cave system extend deeper?
- Are there other entrances/exits?
- What else might have lived here over the centuries?

### Treasure Locations (already looted by party)

The goblins accumulated a small hoard:
- 23 silver pieces (scattered)
- 1 gold ring (stolen from another farm, 8gp value)
- Farming tools Maren recognized as hers
- Various worthless trinkets (buttons, broken toys, shiny rocks)

## Wildlife & Ecology

### Natural Inhabitants

- **Bats:** Roost in the cave during warmer months
- **Mice and rats:** Common in the ruins
- **Snakes:** Occasionally sun themselves on warm stones
- **Spiders:** Large webs in corners of the cave
