# Grassy Foothills (Western Farmlands)

> Rolling grasslands west of Ardenford where sheep graze and hardy farmers eke out a living on rocky soil beneath ancient ruins.

- **Location:** ~2 miles west of Ardenford
- **Terrain:** Grassy hills transitioning to rocky scrubland
- **Elevation:** 200-400 feet
- **Primary Use:** Sheep grazing, small farms
- **Faction:** [Ardenhaven](../_overview.md)
- **Notable Features:** Redwick Farm, old ruin foundations

## Overview

The grassy foothills west of Ardenford stretch for several miles before giving way to denser forest and eventually the mountain foothills. The terrain is characterized by gentle slopes covered in hardy grass, scattered boulders, and rocky outcroppings that jut from the hillsides like ancient bones.

This is farming country, but not the rich farmland of river valleys—this is stubborn land that requires stubborn people. The soil is thin and rocky, but the grass grows thick enough for sheep, and the elevation provides good drainage and clear views of approaching weather (or trouble).

The area is dotted with small farmsteads, stone walls marking property boundaries, and the occasional shepherd's hut. During the day, sheep dot the hillsides like clouds against green slopes. At night, the farms pull in their flocks and light their lanterns, creating small islands of warmth in the darkness.

## Geography

### The Western Approach

The road from Ardenford's western gate meanders through the foothills, following the contours of the land rather than cutting straight. It's wide enough for a cart but unpaved—packed earth and stones that turn muddy in rain.

The landscape opens up as you leave the city, providing excellent sightlines. Hills roll away to the south and west, with the occasional copse of windblown trees clustering in hollows where water collects.

### Terrain Features

**Rocky Scrubland (Southwest)**
- The grass thins out as you head southwest toward [the old ruins](ruins-western-scrubland.md)
- Scattered boulders, some large enough to hide behind
- Low brush and thorny plants
- Evidence of old foundations and collapsed walls from a previous age
- Natural cover for both grazers and predators

**Grazing Hills (Central)**
- Rolling slopes with good grass coverage
- Stone walls dividing different farms' grazing areas
- Natural springs and small streams in some hollows
- Clear views for watching flocks

**Northern Edge**
- Transitions toward denser forest as elevation rises
- More tree coverage, better timber
- Rocky ridges visible in the distance

## Redwick Farm

The most prominent farmstead in this area, owned by Maren Redwick (early 40s, third-generation farmer). The farm consists of:

- **Stone farmhouse** built partially from ancient masonry
- **Large barn** with thatched roof, recently reinforced
- **Sheep pens** near the barn for nighttime security
- **Equipment shed** containing tools, lanterns, and supplies
- **Low stone walls** marking property boundaries

### The Flock

Maren runs approximately 40-50 sheep, primarily for wool production with some sold for meat. The breed is hardy—thick-fleeced, sure-footed, and tolerant of rough terrain. They're trained to respond to whistle commands and gather near the barn at dusk.

### Recent Troubles

**Goblin Raids (3 nights running, recently resolved by adventurers):**
- Goblins from [the old ruins](ruins-western-scrubland.md) raided at dusk
- Lost 12 ewes total before intervention
- Tracks led southwest into rocky scrubland

**Current Status:**
- Raids have stopped (goblins defeated/driven off)
- Flock recovering; some sheep returned alive
- Maren now keeps a closer watch and brings the flock in earlier

## Wildlife & Dangers

### Natural Threats

- **Wolves:** Occasional small packs in winter
- **Mountain cats:** Rare but dangerous to sheep
- **Hawks and eagles:** Threaten lambs in spring
- **Wild boar:** In the forested areas to the north

### Monstrous Threats

- **Goblins:** Recent raids from ruins (now resolved)
- **Kobolds:** Reported in rockier areas, usually avoid confrontation
- **Bandits:** Rare; most prefer the main roads over remote farmland

## Points of Interest

### Shepherd's Outlook

A rocky outcropping about halfway between Ardenford and the ruins, used as a rest stop and observation point. Offers clear views of:
- The western farmlands
- The road back to Ardenford
- The ruins to the southwest
- Approaching weather from the west

Local shepherds have built a small cairn here and occasionally leave supplies (firewood, basic tools) in a stone shelter.

### Old Stone Walls

Throughout the foothills, you'll find low stone walls that predate the current farms. These were built by an earlier civilization, possibly the same one that built the [ruins](ruins-western-scrubland.md). Many farmers have incorporated these walls into their property boundaries or used the stones for new construction.

## Atmosphere & Sensory Details

**Daytime:**
- Bleating of sheep carries across the hills
- Wind rustles through grass; smells clean and earthy
- Distant sounds of farm work: hammering, chopping, dogs barking
- Shadows of clouds racing across green slopes
- Hawks circling high overhead

**Evening (around dusk):**
- Golden light across the hills
- Farmers driving flocks toward barns
- Chimney smoke rising from farmhouses
- Temperature dropping quickly; wind picking up
- Long shadows from boulders and ruins

**Night:**
- Lantern lights from distant farmhouses
- Sheep quiet in their pens
- Wind sounds different—lonelier
- Stars incredibly bright away from city lights
- Occasional distant howl (wolf? dog?)

## Local Attitude

Farmers in this region are practical, hardworking, and mutually supportive. They help each other during lambing season, share news of threats, and trade labor when someone needs a barn raised or a wall rebuilt.

They're welcoming to travelers but cautious of strangers lingering without purpose. Adventurers who help with local problems (like the goblin raids) earn lasting gratitude and are welcomed back anytime.

### Attitude Toward Ardenford

The farmers view the city as necessary but distant. They sell wool and meat there, buy supplies, and appreciate the protection of Ardenhaven's patrols, but they're proudly self-reliant. "City folk don't understand the work" is a common sentiment, though it's not hostile—just matter-of-fact.

## Adventure Hooks

- **Lost Flock:** Sheep have wandered into dangerous areas (ruins, forest, caves)
- **Property Dispute:** Two farmers disagree about wall placement or water rights
- **Strange Tracks:** Something large has been seen moving through the hills at night
- **Seasonal Work:** Farmers need extra hands for shearing, lambing, or stone wall repairs
- **Weather Warning:** Storm approaching; help get flocks to safety

## Connections

- **Ardenford:** 2 miles east; main market for wool and meat
- **[Western Scrubland Ruins](ruins-western-scrubland.md):** Southwest; recent goblin threat
- **Northern Forests:** Timber source; occasional monster threats
- **Eastern Border:** Connects to patrol routes and [watchtowers](../README.md)

## DM Notes

This location serves as:
- **Safe travel zone** between Ardenford and wilderness
- **Low-level quest hub** (animal troubles, bandit encounters, small monster threats)
- **Social anchor** where party can build relationships with commoners
- **Rest point** before or after dungeon delves in nearby ruins

The farmers can provide:
- Local knowledge about ruins, monster sightings, weather patterns
- Safe place to rest (barn accommodations)
- Basic supplies (rope, lanterns, food)
- Gratitude economy (favors, information, future help)
