# World Factions: An Outsider's Perspective

> How the common traveler, merchant, or diplomat sees the major powers of the realm.

## Ardenhaven — The Haven Realm

Ardenhaven is what happens when war-weary city-states decide that survival matters more than pride. Over a century ago, when the Calderon Imperium threatened to swallow them one by one, the border cities and rebel provinces signed the Compact of Unity—a federal republic where no single lord rules, but a Council of Consuls makes decisions together. They call their capital Ardenford, and if you've been there, you know it's not like other cities: no walls, no castle, just a sprawling mess of humanity climbing up a mountainside where ancient ruins decide where streets can go.

The Seven-Year War with Calderon (ᛏ243–ᛏ250) nearly destroyed them. Everyone fought—men, women, anyone old enough to hold a weapon. The stories from that time are grim: mass conscription, starvation sieges, endless casualty lists. When the Pentarch Accords finally ended the war in ᛏ250, both sides were too exhausted to celebrate. Ardenhaven survived, but just barely. They've spent the last 127 years rebuilding, and by all accounts, they've done well. The farmlands produce more grain than before the war, and Ardenhaven has become the continent's breadbasket—exporting surplus to former enemies and neighbors alike.

What makes Ardenhaven unusual is their Ruins Reclamation Act, passed just four years ago in ⋈46. The Council openly admitted they can't afford to explore every ruin in their expanding territory, so they made it legal: find treasure outside the city, keep it. The policy has drawn hundreds of adventurers to the region. Some locals love it—merchants, innkeepers, scholars who get to study what adventurers bring back. Others think it's reckless, worrying that someone will unleash something dangerous or destroy irreplaceable history. Either way, Ardenford's taverns are full of sellswords with empty pockets and sharp opinions.

The government is... complicated. Multiple city-states, each with its own council, and somehow they all have to agree on war and trade while keeping local autonomy. It works, mostly, though you'll hear plenty of grumbling in the markets about inefficiency and endless debates. But here's the thing: people believe in it. After a lifetime of imperial conquest and near-annihilation, Ardenhaven is proof that cooperation can work. It's messy, chaotic, and frustratingly slow—but it's alive, and it's free.

## Araethilion — The Veiled Crown Theocracy

Araethilion is the elven realm in the high forested mountains, and if you're not elven, you probably know three things about them: they're reclusive, they're old, and they're ruled by someone called the Veiled Crown. The elves keep to themselves, and that's fine by most of the continent. They export art, healing services, and beautifully crafted goods through carefully controlled trade channels, but they don't welcome outsiders into their heartland. If you want to deal with Araethilion, you go through their appointed intermediaries, and you don't ask questions.

Their capital is Aeralithil, announced from afar by a enormous, unnaturally tall tower. People say it's the Veiled Crown's personal monument, built to reflect divine authority rather than elven aesthetics. The elves themselves treat it as sacred, and that's all you need to know if you're trading at their borders.

An eclipse is a more common sight than an Araethilion elf.

## Calderon Imperium — The Iron Imperium

If you ask someone about the Calderon Imperium, the answer depends on who you're asking. To those who live within its borders, the Imperium is order incarnate: predictable laws, safe roads, functioning infrastructure, and a bureaucracy that actually answers petitions. To those who live outside—especially in Ardenhaven—the Imperium is the boot that nearly crushed them, and memory runs deep.

The Imperium is built on the principle that law should be uniform, centralized, and absolute. There's an Emperor or Empress at the top, followed by the High Edict Council and the Censorate—the registry-keepers who track every citizen, every transaction, every licensed trade. If you live in the Imperium, you know exactly where you stand: follow the rules, prosper; break them, and the legions will remind you why that was a mistake. The system is efficient, ruthless, and entirely unbothered by moral ambiguity.

Historically, the Imperium tried to expand aggressively. The Seven-Year War with Ardenhaven (ᛏ243–ᛏ250) ended in a bloody stalemate, formalized by the Pentarch Accords. Since then, the Imperium has officially embraced peace and trade, but no one trusts them completely. The legions are rearming. The borders are fortified. And while merchants cross into Imperium territory every day, they do so with permits, inspections, and the constant awareness that the Imperium tolerates trade, it doesn't love it.

In ⋈50, the general consensus among merchants and diplomats is that the Age of Trade has done what treaties alone could not: made war economically irrational. The Imperium and Ardenhaven are now major trading partners, and the benefits of open commerce far outweigh any territorial ambitions. Disrupting trade would hurt the Imperium's economy as much as anyone else's, and that mutual dependency has created a form of peace that feels more stable than any signature on parchment. In Merrowgate's counting houses and Ardenford's markets, people talk about the Imperium with caution but not fear—they're a partner now, not an enemy. Still, no one's suggesting dismantling the watch towers along the southern border. Trust, yes. Blind trust, no.

## Dulgarum Oathholds — The Oathbound Holds

> We are born of stone, and die as stone

Outsiders often shorten the name to “Oathhold dwarves.” Some will say “the Oathhold’s dwarves,” but most people learn fast not to add the ’s. In Common it lands like ownership, and dwarves hear it the way you’d hear “the kennel’s dogs.” The confusing part is that many dwarves do use possessive language about the Holds in prayers and old sayings—stone as kin, stone as duty, stone as judge. But that’s their language for themselves. Coming from an outsider, it’s an insult.

There's a proverb travelers repeat (usually with a nervous laugh): "We don't own the mountain. The mountain owns us." Whether that's poetry, religion, or just how dwarves talk about duty and belonging is hard to say. But it explains why the idea exists at all—and why outsiders get warned off the possessive.

Dwarves are rare outside their own lands. Not as rare as spotting an Araethilion elf on the road, but rare enough that if you meet one, you remember it. Rare enough that an Oathhold dwarf will sometimes grit their teeth and stay polite even if you commit the classic insult: mistaking them for a dwarf of the Garhammar Trade League.

To most non-dwarves, the mistake is understandable. Dwarves from both nations can look and dress similarly, and they share gods and old cultural habits. If you know nothing about dwarven politics, you might assume Dulgarum and Garhammar are rival guilds inside one united people.

And yet, for all the shared surface, outsiders rarely learn how—or why—one people became two nations. Ask a dwarf and you'll get a look that says you shouldn't have asked. They'll speak of kin, of the People, of old obligations, and then—carefully—make it clear that Dulgarum and Garhammar are not the same and not ruled the same.

From the outside, the best way to understand it is as a family split by belief. They still sit at the same tables in neutral halls, still trade when the rules demand it, and you won't often hear a dwarf spit the other nation's name in public. But the tension is obvious, always present, and never spoken aloud. Push for details and both sides go quiet.

That's about all most outsiders know for certain. Dulgarum keeps to itself.

## Elderholt — The Coven Realm

Ask about Elderholt in a tavern and watch the conversation die. Someone will mention the dark pine forests. Someone else will say there's barely any settlement there—maybe a few thousand witches, maybe more; no one counts them. A third voice will insist there are tens of thousands, hidden in places that don't show on maps. All three will agree on this: you don't go looking for Elderholt unless you're desperate or stupid, and only one of those gets you home alive.

The stories don't match, and that's the problem. A merchant swears he saw a single witch level a bandit camp with a word and a gesture—just her, no one else. An old scholar insists the witches came from the Underdark centuries ago—crawled up from the deep places. The timing is undeniable, he says: their emergence is what forced the world to declare the Age of Conflict.

Before the witches surfaced, drow raids were common across the continent. After? Nothing. Not silence. Not retreat. *Absence*. The drow didn't go deeper—they stopped existing. No bodies. No survivors fleeing to neighboring realms. No distant kingdoms reporting refugees. Just… gone. The terror of that erasure, he argues, is why that age bears its name. Another voice will insist that's superstition, that the drow are still down there, just quiet now, just afraid. But when pressed to explain why no drow has been seen in centuries—at least, none that anyone can prove—not in any tunnel, not in any kingdom, not even as slaves or traders, the voice falters. A farmer insists she met a witch who told her the coven was "smaller than you'd think, but larger than you'd survive." When you ask her to clarify, she changes the subject.

There's a story told at firesides in villages near the dark woods. Parents whisper it to children, innkeepers share it with travelers, and everyone who hears it remembers. It goes like this:

*If you see a lost girl at night—alone, cold, standing at your door or the edge of your lamplight—you take her in. You feed her. You give her warmth and shelter. You ask no questions. Because she will remember your face.*

*If you turn her away, if you close your door, if you pretend you didn't see her—she will remember that too. And when she walks into those trees and doesn't come back out the way she went in, when the forest claims her and teaches her and changes her into something that no longer needs your pity—one night, years later, you'll see her again. But she won't be cold anymore. She won't be helpless. And she will remember your face.*

## Garhammar Trade League — The Free Guild-League

If Dulgarum is tradition and honor, Garhammar is profit and pragmatism. Garhammar is rich. Spectacularly, unapologetically rich. They sell weapons, machines, arbitration services, and banking to anyone who can pay. During the Seven-Year War between Ardenhaven and Calderon, Garhammar sold arms to both sides and profited massively. They call it "neutrality through economic indispensability." Critics call it opportunism. Either way, it works. Garhammar's guild-ruled society operates on charter law: policy is decided by votes weighted by capital, meaning the richest guildmasters control the League's direction.

The dwarven people are split between Garhammar and Dulgarum, but you won’t often hear a dwarf speak ill of the other nation in front of outsiders. Mention the League to a Oathbound dwarf and the conversation gets careful; ask a Garhammar dwarf about the Oathbound and you’ll get formal answers with sharp edges. Outsiders reduce it to a simple story—tradition versus profit—but 

One thing outsiders notice: Garhammar employs a lot of non-dwarf labor. Humans, half-orcs, even goblins work the mines and forges, often in exploitative conditions. The League insists this is efficient economics. Labor organizers call it abuse. Either way, Garhammar keeps making money, and the guilds keep expanding.

If you need cutting-edge tools, high-quality weapons, or someone to arbitrate a complex trade dispute, Garhammar is where you go. Just don't expect them to care about your cause—only your coin.

## Garrok Confederation — Western Orc Confederation

The Garrok Confederation is proof that orcs can be more than raiders and warbands—though that doesn't stop outsiders from assuming otherwise. The Confederation is a union of autonomous orc clans bound by shared law, mutual defense treaties, and an honor-based justice system that can look unnervingly strict to human courts.

The Confederation's relationship with Ardenhaven is complicated but functional. Treaties allow limited trade and mutual defense, and both sides keep to the terms with a seriousness that surprises first-time diplomats. If you betray a Garrok orc, expect every clan to remember. If you earn their respect, you've gained allies who value honor over convenience.

The Garrok code revolves around recompense: blood-price and honor-debt systems enforced by Oathfire Judges. Commit an offense, pay the price—literally. It's formalized, ritualized, and taken deadly seriously, with prescribed courtesies and public acknowledgments that turn personal grudges into clan business. Outsiders sometimes mistake this for primitive justice, but it's anything but.

Garrok also deals with the Calderon Imperium, but outsiders rarely get a clean story about it. Garrok speakers go polite and vague; Imperium officials go stiff and legal. Whatever the truth is, both sides act like a single misstep could become a formal grievance—and then a formal war.

## Merrowgate — The City of Bargains

Merrowgate is where everyone goes when they need to make a deal. It's a city-state that declared itself neutral centuries ago, and somehow, it's stayed that way through wars, sieges, and continental upheavals. The secret? Merrowgate makes itself indispensable. Every major faction relies on its trade networks, banking services, arbitration courts, and neutral ground for diplomacy. If you shut down Merrowgate, the continental economy grinds to a halt.

The city is ruled by the Ledger Council—merchant princes, guildmasters, and extremely well-dressed crime lords who vote on policy and somehow always align with prosperity. Merrowgate operates on contract law, enforced by the Scriveners' Guild (also known as the Ink), who bind agreements with enchantments so powerful that breaking your word becomes immediately costly.

The Charter of Open Waters (ᛏ227) formalized Merrowgate's neutrality and maritime dominance. The Scriveners' Reformation (ᛏ232) introduced contract-binding enchantments that work across borders, making Merrowgate contracts the gold standard for international trade. The Pentarch Accords were signed here in ᛏ250, ending the Imperial Wars. The Covenant Summit (⋈50) recently brought all eight major factions together for the largest trade conference in history.

Every New Year's Eve, the Patron grants one petition to the city. People line up to request favors, and sometimes, impossibly, those favors are granted. Is it a god? A council of merchants? A criminal mastermind? No one knows, and Merrowgate isn't telling.

Merrowgate's motto is "All debts settled, all gates open." They mean it. The city welcomes everyone, serves everyone, and profits from everyone. Just remember: in Merrowgate, everything has a price, and the contract is always binding.

## Rakthok Horde — Eastern Orc Horde

Ask anyone outside the Horde about Rakthok, and you'll hear the same story: violent raiders, unpredictable aggressors, a constant threat to border settlements and trade roads. Merchants talk about burned wagons and vanished caravans. Border towns talk about night horns and smoke on the horizon. Even people who’ve never been east of Merrowgate speak as if the Horde is a storm front—something you track, fear, and pray turns away.

In the Age of Trade, that reputation matters. Most travelers don’t care about the Horde’s reasons. They care that contracts can’t be enforced against someone who won’t sign them, and that prosperity dies the moment caravans need armies to move. Rakthok raids don’t just steal goods—they undermine the premise that the continent can be held together by law, coin, and predictable roads.

That is why the Calderon Imperium holds the line, and why most of the world quietly accepts it. Whatever people think of Imperial permits and watchtowers, the borders stay watched and the roads stay open. Without that containment, trade collapses. Without trade, law becomes local again, and local fear becomes local war. Calderon calls it containment because that is what it is: the unpleasant work of keeping the Age of Trade from being broken by raids and reprisals.

## Final Notes

These perspectives reflect **public knowledge**—what merchants, diplomats, travelers, and tavern-goers know or believe. They are shaped by propaganda, limited contact, and selective storytelling. The truth is often more complex, but for most people navigating this world, these are the stories that matter.
