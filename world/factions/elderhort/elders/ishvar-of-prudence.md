Elder Ishvar [Ish-vahr] of Prudence

She rearly asks the Voice for anything herself. Instead, she convinces others to do it *for everyone*. A master of coven law and softer lies, she stays impeccably within doctrine while maneuvering her sisters into bargains that conveniently advance her designs. Every toll is taken for “the greater good,” every sacrifice framed as necessary, every benefit somehow hers to direct. No rule is broken, no crime committed—only the spirit of the coven slowly bent out of shape.

Among the elders, she is joked about and quietly feared. Accusing her outright would tear the coven apart, so instead she is treated as a lesson: proof that survival within the rules can still be a kind of corruption.
