## Elder Kharbora the Living Shadow (KHAR-bor-ah)

*Lesson: The price of power is yours alone to judge.*

### Who She Was

Kharbora began as a dwarven Ward-Witch, stubborn and sharp-tongued, famous for holding the line in some of Elderholt’s worst winters. She stood on walls until her feet bled, traded years of her life for unbroken wards, and never once asked another witch to shoulder a cost she could bear herself.

### What She Sacrificed

They say she traded away her sight first, so she could see only the shimmer of wards and the edges of danger. Then she gave up her reflection, so the Voice could not use her own image against her. Eventually, even her body and the light that clung to it were offered. Kharbora is now a shapeless, inky silhouette of a person with burning amber sigils where eyes should be. As cold as it is to touch her, Kharbora's demeanor is aggressive and vivid—her emotions and passions still as fierce as when she was fully dwarven.

Kharbora is a witch who sacrificed everything physical and yet retains her mind completely.

### How She Appears Now

To most, she looks like a hole in the world: a jagged shadow that moves without a source, edged in faint warding runes. Her "eyes" are twin embers of amber light, flaring brighter when she is angry or amused. Lanterns dim when she passes. Children say you can feel the cold of stone keep-walls radiating from her.




### Role in the Covens

Kharbora is opinionated and unyielding. She believes that whether a sacrifice to the Voice is worth it can only ever be decided by the witch who strikes the bargain. She despises pity and loathes those who push others to pay prices they would not pay themselves. A common fear among the wider coven is what Kharbora will sacrifice next—and whether she will still be able to stand watch if she offers up too much.

### Using Kharbora in Play

Kharbora is the elder who snarls at hesitation but refuses to make choices for others. She is ideal for scenes where a PC must decide how far they are willing to go. She will not tell them what the "right" answer is, only that they will live—or not—with what they give away.

## Elder Vezrugar the Empty Vessel (VEZ-roo-gar)

*Lesson: You can give up feeling and still choose to care.*

### Who She Was

Vezrugar is an elderly orc witch who once burned hot with anger and joy in equal measure. As a young Tollbearer she was known for laughing in the face of danger and weeping openly at funerals. Her emotions were a storm that the covens both relied on and feared.

### What She Sacrificed

They say that fear was the first emotion Elder Vez surrendered, trading it for the clarity to stand firm when others flinched. Over the years, grief, joy, anger, jealousy, and even love were each given up in turn to fuel her bargains. Now she is deathly thin, and beneath her skin bright lights shine like caged stars. Silver stains mark her cheeks like tattoos, the visible record of each feeling surrendered.

Her voice is steady, incapable of wavering. Her eyes shine with cold logic. And yet, one of her gifts is the ability to **see** emotions. She reads heartbreak, fear, excitement, and pity as easily as one reads a book, even if she does not feel any of it herself.

Vez is Kharbora’s opposite: a witch whose sacrifices were more of the mind than of the body.

### How She Appears Now

Up close, Vezrugar looks like a lantern made of skin and bone. Light leaks through her ribs when she breathes. Her silver cheek-marks glimmer faintly when someone nearby feels something strongly. Witch-children whisper that if you stand in her shadow while lying, the light under her skin flickers.

### Role in the Covens

Witch-children are afraid of her; she comes across as so alien and unreadable. Yet Elder Vez spends much of her time with witches who are growing into their womanhood, guiding, counseling, and shaping them through their struggles. She cannot feel their pain, but she can see it, name it, and help them decide what to do with it.

### Using Vezrugar in Play

Vezrugar is perfect for hard conversations and quiet scenes. She can tell a PC exactly what they are feeling and how sharply—without judgment or comfort. Her presence pushes players to articulate what they want and what they are willing to lose, knowing she will not flinch or soften the truth.

## Elder Arlen the Tithe-Bearer (AR-len)

*Lesson: One sin can be answered with a lifetime of choosing better.*

### Who She Was

Elder Arlen began as the product of a sin. Her mother used her as a shield in a bargain, offering Arlen’s life and soul to the Voice to escape a price she herself refused to pay. The rite twisted and damaged the child; her body was saved, but her soul was forever scarred. Somehow, Arlen survived the Axiom and grew into adulthood, carrying that original wound like a hairline crack through glass.

### What She Sacrificed

As a grown witch, Arlen did the unthinkable: she volunteers to pay the price for others whenever another witch faces a toll too steep—a shattered limb, a stolen voice, a mind-splintering vision. Each time, she steps forward and says, "Take it from me instead."

At this point, Arlen is misshapen, a collage of a hundred different bargains. One arm is made of bonded branches dripping with ink, one eye a molten rune like a cracked lantern. Her shadow walks with a limp from a curse she absorbed. Her lungs whistle with frost. Her heartbeat crackles as light that sometimes shines through her skin.

### How She Appears Now

Despite the chaos of her body, Arlen remains upright and warm. Her smile is lopsided but genuine; her touch is steady. Children and witch-children alike find themselves instinctively trusting her, even as they flinch from the shifting, impossible shapes she carries.

### Role in the Covens

Arlen is merciful in a place that rarely has room for mercy. She does not erase consequences—those who try to use her as a shield the way her mother did find her anger is still very much intact. But when a witch has done everything right and the price is still cruel, Arlen is there to step between them and the Voice.

### Using Arlen in Play

Arlen is the elder who offers the party a way out—at a cost they may not want someone else to pay. She is ideal for moments when a character is about to lose something core to themselves, and you want to ask: *Will you let someone who has already been broken take this one too?* Her presence turns every bargain into a moral choice, not just a mechanical one.

## Elder Titles and Monikers

To survive long enough to become an **Elder** is one of the highest honors in Elderholt. Every bargain with the Voice is a roll of weighted dice, and most witches never grow old. The title "Elder" marks those who have endured not just years, but decades of sacrifice.

Among witches, earned monikers and titles end up far more important than surnames. Family is not the focus in Elderholt; what you sacrificed, and what you became, says far more about who you are. "Living Shadow," "Empty Vessel," "Tithe-Bearer"—these are not nicknames but histories, written in flesh and fate.

Such titles are meant to be feared, revered, and, most of all, respected.
