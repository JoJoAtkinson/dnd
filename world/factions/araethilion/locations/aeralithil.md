# Aeralithil (AIR-ah-LITH-il)

> Sacred heart-city beneath the Veiled Crown.

- Culture: Elven (Araethilion)
- Type: Capital city
- Faction: [Araethilion](../_overview.md)

## Description
Aeralithil is a radiant forest capital where living temples and songwoven halls encircle Elaerith’s courts. Beauty and abundance mask a harsher truth: proximity to the living god is privilege. 

## Points of Interest
- The Veiled Court — the inner rings of proximity, where access is power
- Lifebloom Hall — where the Silver Thread is bound in intimate rite
- Whisper Galleries — dissident circles trading rumors of exile, Severance, and forgotten names
