The Unthreaded

Not all the inhabitants of Elderholt are witches. All men and the few women who do not hear the Voice are still a part of the island's society. They farm the thin soil between dark pine roots, keep bees where the forest thins, fish the black waters along the stone coast, and tend ovens that never quite go cold.

Children who never hear the Voice are watched carefully at first. When it becomes clear that they will never be threaded, families grieve privately, then settle. These children grow up with practical skills, steady hands, and complicated relationships with the witches who shape their home but do not quite share it.

Many stay. A few leave. Leaving is not forbidden, but it is quietly mourned.

Most unthreaded respect the coven. Some fear it. A few resent it deeply. They bring food to rituals, repair doors warped by magic, and clean up what remains when spells go wrong. In return, the witches protect the island and its people.

There is an unspoken rule: The unthreaded do not ask for magic. The witches do not ask for understanding. 

The unthreaded have several festivals throughout the year: the Emberwake in the winter, the Tidebound Fair in the summer. Witches are invited as guests but do not participate and do not lead the functions or their magicless cousins' society. From afar these could easily be mistaken for witches' ceremonies.

For food: root based stews: turnips, onions, and mushrooms are common. Black pine bread is baked, often combined with honey or jams made from local berries. Smoked fish acts as much of the protein for the people.

Two artistic traditions common among the unthreaded are wood carving and quilting. Wood carvings can be found in walking sticks, doorframes, cutlerly, and trinkets. They often feature etchings with repeating patterns that echo ward symbols without truly being them.

Quilts tell stories with each frame telling a tale in a person's life and often being passed down through families.
