- The witches closed off the underdark 
Kharbora dosn't know them as matron mothers, but you do as a player. In effect, she describes going into the under-dark with several other edlers, some you never met, and murdering several of them. She retails her part in great detail, but doesn't recall the wider story. She knows the Witches acted as one, and they deemed it necessary 

Taramet describes building a huge door locking away a corridor to a the deep unknown (the underdark), she dosn't remember where she built it, and she is afraid she lost the key; dosn't seem too worried about the key tho.
