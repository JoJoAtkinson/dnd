Player question to the elder witches:

Where should Marwen say she is from if asked in the wider world? Is it okay to say she is from Elderholt or should she lie?

[Brannith](../elders/brannith-the-hag-overlooked.md), [Ishvar](../elders/ishvar-of-prudence.md), [Taramet](../elders/taramet-the-forge.md), [Raven](../elders/raven-the-vital-ascendant.md), [Marrith](../elders/marrith-the-ashen-measure.md).


## Brannith's Advice

Brannith gives her typical witch’s cackle—except when you think it’s about to end, she sucks up more air and continues. “Young witch, you know how to make an old woman laugh. Of course you can tell folks where you come from.” She turns to Marwen with her infamous wide, many-teeth smile. “Raven loves visitors”—in sincere honesty.

## Ishvar's Advice

Ishvar folds her hands as if they are part of the rule she’s about to recite.

“Did you ask me for this advice first, or did you ask Brannith?” Ishvar can’t help but hide a subtle twitch at the corner of her mouth—irritation, gone as soon as it appears.

Before Marwen can answer, she gestures to stop with half an eye-roll. “It does not matter.”

“Where you are from,” she says gently—almost to herself, as if recalling the context—before meeting Marwen’s eyes, “people do not ask that question to learn you. They ask it to decide what they can take from you.”

She studies Marwen with the calm patience of a magistrate who already knows the verdict.

“Do not lie when you can withhold. A lie opens a door for them to tug on. Silence is a closed door.”

She taps one finger on the table—once, precise.

“If you must answer, give them something that costs you nothing. A town that cannot be found. A road you truly walked. ‘North of the pines.’ ‘From a small stead.’ ‘From nowhere worth writing down.’ Make it dull. Make it forgettable. Make it true enough that it does not snag.”

Her eyes soften only slightly.

“Elderholt is a name that carries its own consequences. To some it will sound like a threat. To others, an opportunity. To the wrong ear, it becomes an invitation to test you, bargain with you, hunt you, or sell you. You are a young witch, Marwen. You do not get to wear that name in strange markets like a cloak and expect it not to catch on nails.”

A pause—long enough to feel like a rule settling into place.

“When you are among those who have earned the right to know, you may say it. When you need the coven’s shadow to protect you, you may say it. When you want to be seen, when being seen will help you more than it harms you—then, and only then, you may say it.”

She leans forward, voice still mild.

“Until you can afford the truth, spend it like coin: rarely, deliberately, and never in front of someone who is counting your purse.”

“Now go. Go run off to Brannith,” she says, waving you off as she continues her work.

## Taramet's Advice

“Don’t lie. Shape it. Give them a handle that fits their grip and keeps their fingers away from the blade. ‘I’m from the north woods.’ ‘I’m from a small stead.’ ‘I travel.’ Let them think they’ve held you without actually holding you.”

## Raven's Advice

Marwen finds Raven on the eastern side of Elderholt. Marwen wasn’t looking for Raven so much as collecting ingredients for some of the petitioners. Not passing up an opportunity to gain insight, she asks Raven: “I’m leaving soon to learn of the outside world. What should I tell people I’m from?”

Raven moves just enough to inform Marwen that she heard the question. She spots a leg, pulls it free, and finds it detached from its body. She stares at the patch of ground it came from with something like disappointment before discarding the body part to one side.

In a deadpan, steady, even tone of voice:

“I love visitors.”

Before walking off in search of more body parts—without even a goodbye.

## Marrith’s Advice

Marrith does not answer the question the way the others do. She listens, once, as if setting the words on a scale.

Then she says, flatly, “You already know what to say. Say less than you want to. Say nothing when you can.”

Marwen starts to nod—relieved—until Marrith adds, as if remembering something she’d hoped not to teach:

“There are lost witches who escaped judgment, and they yearn to be whole again. They can sense their own kind the way smoke finds a crack. There is no ‘them’ left anymore. They may not even look like witches now—monsters, through and through—and they cannot be reasoned with.”

Her gaze fixes on Marwen like a latch clicking shut.

“If you find one in the wild, you do not face it. You do not watch it. You do not get brave. Send a crow. Mark the place from a distance. Put a ward between it and the road only if you can do it without being seen—then leave. Better to leave the ending to Raven and me.”

Marrith calls down a crow from the treetops. Marwen didn’t know Marrith kept crows—whether this is a pet, or a spell, or simply something the wards allow.

“He knows his way home,” she says, smearing an ash-sigil along the crow’s leg. “And I will know where he began.”

Then—sharp, immediate—she adds, “That crow is not for your convenience. You do not spend it on gossip, pride, or panic. You send it once, for this, and only this: a lost witch that needs tending. If you cannot name the threat, you keep your hands off my messenger.”

“And if I am discovered by such a witch,” Marwen asks—without eagerness, without pride—“or if she is preying on others… then what do I do?”

Marrith’s answer comes too quickly.

“Run.”

She takes two steps as if the lesson is done—then stops hard. Marrith turns back, grabs Marwen by the shoulders, and squares her up. Her grip is firm, not cruel. She looks Marwen straight in the eyes and holds her there.

For a long moment, she says nothing.

“You want your independence,” Marrith says at last. “Good. Then find yourself a competent traveling party that can hold their own. Do not go alone because you are proud. Pride is a luxury. You are leaving the forest.”

Her voice drops, turning measured, as if she’s reciting a rule that has been paid for in blood.

“Remember this carefully: if you can run from it, you run. If you can’t run from it, you try to talk to it—just long enough. If you’re lucky, there’s enough left inside it to make it pause.”

Marrith’s thumbs tighten once, a warning in miniature.

“Lie. Promise you can heal it. There is no cure. Don’t get sentimental. Do what you need to do so your allies can get the jump on it.”

She leans in, close enough that Marwen can smell ash and cold pine.

“It wants you,” Marrith says. “Remember that. Use that.”

She lets go, like releasing a held door.

“Live.”

## Silniel

Marwen stopped and stared up at the thick branches of the witch-tree, as she had done dozens of times over the past few weeks, the dream scratching at the edges of her mind.

When she was a young girl, the impulse had struck her to climb Silniel. She remembered her bark gnawing into her palms, nearly losing her grip, and barely making it to the first branch before another witch snapped at her to get down, that she was being disrespectful. A smile crossed Marwen's lips. She had only wanted to play with the elder, to spend time with her.

But Marwen was no longer a witch-child and no longer waited for permission from others to act. She threw down her pack, opened one of the pouches on her belt, and pulled out a thin, dried grasshopper leg. "Talo lai, ort-ni," she hissed and snapped the leg in half. Without any effort she leapt into the first branches of the tree, sending leaves rustling and charms clattering against one another as she used the magic of her spell to swiften her climb.

What was elation upon first reaching the top quickly turned to disappointment. The view wasn't as majestic as it had been in the dream and she didn't feel closer to Silniel. She remained up there long past when the magic of her spell faded, her confusion increasing. Eventually, she climbed down the hard way and retrieved her pack.

DM NOTE: this means the Silniel has left seeds unannouned on Marwen to be left in the world at large.
