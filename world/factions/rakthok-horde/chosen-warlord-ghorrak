## Overview

Ghorrak, son of Bazrak, is the First Striker and Chosen Warlord of the Rakthok Horde. Renowned for his battlefield prowess and unwavering devotion to the ancestral ways, Ghorrak commands respect and fear in equal measure. He is the living embodiment of the Horde’s traditions, leading with a blend of iron discipline and spiritual authority. Ghorrak’s leadership is marked by his refusal to question the wisdom of the Ancestors, a trait that often puts him at odds with his younger brother, Bazgar.

## Appearance

Ghorrak is imposing even by orc standards—broad-shouldered, heavily muscled, and bearing the ritual scars and tattoos of a warlord. His armor is a masterwork of blackened iron and alligator hide, adorned with spirit-flame motifs and clan insignia. His tusks are prominent, and his gaze is intense, reflecting both the burdens of command and the certainty of his convictions.

## Personality

- **Traits:** Stern, disciplined, slow to trust outsiders, unwavering in faith, expects absolute loyalty.
- **Ideals:** The Ancestors’ wisdom is law. The Horde survives through unity and strength.
- **Bonds:** Bound to the spirits of the Black Marsh, sworn to protect the Dakmar’nak and the Horde at any cost. Deep, if unspoken, loyalty to his family.
- **Flaws:** Inflexible, dismissive of new ideas, struggles to see value in change or dissent.

## Backstory

Ghorrak’s rise to Warlord was forged in the crucible of endless conflict. As the eldest son of Bazrak, he was expected to lead, and he met every challenge with ferocity and resolve. Ghorrak’s faith in the Ancestors and the old ways is absolute; he believes that only by following tradition can the Horde survive the threats of the Imperium and the blighted lands. His relationship with his younger brother, [Bazgar Dakmar'nak](../../../characters/player-characters/jeff-bazgar.md), is strained by Bazgar’s questioning nature and ambition, yet Ghorrak respects his brother’s courage, even if he cannot condone his defiance.
