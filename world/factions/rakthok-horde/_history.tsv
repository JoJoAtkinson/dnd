rakthok-bloodbridge-hold	rakthok-horde;siege;calderon-imperium	4293/10/14	0	Bloodbridge Hold	They wanted a bridge for their wagons of iron and dead. We held the ford in rain and arrows, then broke the scaffold into the current so no wheel could follow.
rakthok-saltford-ledgers	public;rakthok-horde;conflict;calderon-imperium;garhammar-trade-league	4296	0	Saltford Ledger Dispute	An Imperial “audit” turns bloody; Calderon pamphlets blame Rakthok raiders for attacking inspectors over a minor tariff quarrel.

rakthok-boneyards-wake	rakthok-horde;raids;calderon-imperium	4311	0	Boneyard Wake Break	We struck the bone-yard to free the taken and scatter the stacked corpses before the engines could wake them; the Imperium calls it “desecration” because it broke their machine.
rakthok-sundered-urns-night	rakthok-horde;crime;calderon-imperium	4313/12/21	0	Sundered Urns Night	They dug where we laid our dead and tried to steal the seals that keep names safe. We broke their hands, broke their urns, and broke the script so no chain could find our ancestors.

rakthok-red-cairn-countermarch	public;calderon-imperium;conflict;rakthok-horde	4324	0	Red Cairn Countermarch	Calderon officers report an “unprovoked raid” that pushed the frontier markers north; the Rakthok are blamed for refusing peace and hunting traders for sport.
rakthok-red-cairn-countermarch	calderon-imperium;conflict;rakthok-horde	4324	0	Red Cairn Countermarch	Our cairns were opened and our boundary stones moved; we answered with steel, took the ground back, and left no bodies for their collectors—only ash and broken chains.

The ruling became a blade; we held the river-scar and bled the patrols until they learned our land is not a ledger.
