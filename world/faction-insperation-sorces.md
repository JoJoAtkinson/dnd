# Faction Inspiration Sources

This is a **real-world inspiration map** for each in-world faction: aesthetics, institutions, values, and “how they behave under pressure.”

- This is **not** a 1:1 equivalence or a historical claim.
- Use these as **research starting points** and tonal anchors; avoid flattening any culture into a stereotype.
- Links point to each faction’s overview for quick context.
