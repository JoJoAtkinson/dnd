# Underground Ruins Monsters

Custom creatures for underground exploration in ancient ruins.

---

## 1. Stone Whisperer (CR 3)

**Medium aberration, neutral evil**

An unsettling fusion of ancient stone and corrupted flesh that dwells in the deep ruins. Its body appears as if someone tried to carve a humanoid from rock but the stone grew veins and learned to breathe.

**Armor Class** 13 (natural armor)  
**Hit Points** 58 (9d8 + 18)  
**Speed** 20 ft., burrow 10 ft.

hp: 25

hp: -25

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 16 (+3) | 10 (+0) | 14 (+2) | 12 (+1) | 14 (+2) | 8 (-1) |

**Skills** Perception +4, Stealth +4  
**Damage Resistances** bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks  
**Senses** darkvision 120 ft., tremorsense 30 ft., passive Perception 14  
**Languages** Understands Ancient but can't speak, communicates through vibrations

### Traits

**Stone Camouflage.** The stone whisperer has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in rocky terrain or ruins.

**Resonant Body.** When the stone whisperer takes thunder damage, each creature within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be deafened until the end of their next turn.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** The stone whisperer makes two attacks: one with its slam and one with its stone shard.

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage.

**Stone Shard.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (2d4 + 3) piercing damage. The whisperer tears a chunk of stone from its own body to hurl.

**Petrifying Touch (Recharge 5-6).** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or begin to turn to stone and be restrained. The restrained target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the target is petrified for 1 hour.

### Tactics
Stone whisperers wait motionless until prey approaches, then strike with petrifying touch to disable the strongest threat. They communicate through vibrations in stone, warning others of their kind.

## 2. Void Crawler (CR 4)

**Large aberration, chaotic evil**

A horrifying creature that seems to be made of the absence of light given form. Where it moves, darkness clings like oil, and its many-jointed legs tap rhythms that hurt to hear.

**Armor Class** 14 (natural armor)  
**Hit Points** 68 (8d10 + 24)  
**Speed** 40 ft., climb 40 ft.

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 17 (+3) | 15 (+2) | 16 (+3) | 6 (-2) | 12 (+1) | 7 (-2) |

**Skills** Stealth +6  
**Damage Resistances** necrotic  
**Senses** blindsight 60 ft., darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 11  
**Languages** —

### Traits

**Aura of Darkness.** The void crawler emits magical darkness in a 15-foot radius. Darkvision can't penetrate this darkness, and no natural light can illuminate it. If any of the darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled.

**Spider Climb.** The void crawler can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** The void crawler makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage.

**Void Screech (Recharge 5-6).** The void crawler emits a bone-chilling screech. Each creature within 30 feet that can hear it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the void crawler's Void Screech for the next 24 hours.

### Tactics
Void crawlers use their darkness aura to disorient prey, climbing on walls and ceilings to attack from unexpected angles. They prefer to isolate stragglers from groups.

## 3. Ruin Wraith (CR 5)

**Medium undead, lawful evil**

The tortured remnant of an ancient civilization's guardian, still trying to fulfill a purpose it can no longer remember. It appears as a humanoid figure in corroded armor, face obscured by a helm that seeps cold mist.

**Armor Class** 14  
**Hit Points** 67 (9d8 + 27)  
**Speed** 0 ft., fly 60 ft. (hover)

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 6 (-2) | 18 (+4) | 16 (+3) | 12 (+1) | 14 (+2) | 15 (+2) |

**Damage Resistances** acid, cold, fire, lightning, thunder; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks  
**Damage Immunities** necrotic, poison  
**Condition Immunities** charmed, exhaustion, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained  
**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 12  
**Languages** Ancient (understands but can't speak)

### Traits

**Incorporeal Movement.** The ruin wraith can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the ruin wraith has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

**Bound to Ruins.** The ruin wraith cannot willingly move more than 100 feet from the ruins it is bound to.

### Actions

**Life Drain.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 21 (4d8 + 4) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

**Forgotten Command (Recharge 5-6).** The ruin wraith speaks a command in Ancient that reverberates through stone. Each creature within 30 feet that can hear it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to move up to its speed in a direction of the wraith's choosing and use its action to make one weapon attack against a target of the wraith's choosing. Creatures that don't understand Ancient have advantage on this saving throw.

**Create Spawn.** A humanoid slain by the ruin wraith's Life Drain rises 24 hours later as a shadow under the wraith's control, unless the humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed.

### Tactics
Ruin wraiths often try to confuse intruders with Forgotten Command, turning allies against each other. They phase through walls to ambush from unexpected directions and retreat when damaged.

## 4. Glyphspider (CR 2)

**Small construct, unaligned**

A spider-like construct made of articulated stone segments covered in glowing runes. Created by the ancient civilization as living alarm systems, they still patrol certain ruins.

**Armor Class** 16 (natural armor)  
**Hit Points** 45 (10d6 + 10)  
**Speed** 30 ft., climb 30 ft.

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 14 (+2) | 16 (+3) | 12 (+1) | 3 (-4) | 10 (+0) | 1 (-5) |

**Damage Immunities** poison, psychic  
**Condition Immunities** charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned  
**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10  
**Languages** Understands Ancient but can't speak

### Traits

**Rune Network.** When a glyphspider detects an intruder, all glyphspiders within 300 feet become aware of the intruder's location.

**Magic Resistance.** The glyphspider has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Spider Climb.** The glyphspider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** The glyphspider makes two leg strike attacks.

**Leg Strike.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage.

**Rune Burst (Recharge 5-6).** The glyphspider's runes flare with energy. Each creature within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (4d6) force damage and be pushed 10 feet away from the glyphspider.

### Tactics
Glyphspiders work in coordinated groups, using their Rune Network to surround intruders. They prioritize protecting specific areas or objects, fighting to the death rather than retreating.

## 5. Tunnel Shambler (CR 6)

**Large ooze, unaligned**

A massive, vaguely humanoid mass of living stone and earth that has absorbed centuries of sediment, bones, and debris. It moves with the slow inevitability of a cave-in made flesh.

**Armor Class** 12 (natural armor)  
**Hit Points** 126 (12d10 + 60)  
**Speed** 20 ft., burrow 20 ft.

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 20 (+5) | 6 (-2) | 20 (+5) | 2 (-4) | 6 (-2) | 1 (-5) |

**Damage Resistances** bludgeoning, piercing  
**Damage Immunities** acid, poison  
**Condition Immunities** blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, prone  
**Senses** blindsight 60 ft. (blind beyond this radius), tremorsense 60 ft., passive Perception 8  
**Languages** —

### Traits

**Amorphous.** The tunnel shambler can move through a space as narrow as 1 foot wide without squeezing.

**Earth Absorption.** Whenever the tunnel shambler is subjected to acid damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the acid damage dealt.

**Siege Monster.** The tunnel shambler deals double damage to objects and structures.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** The tunnel shambler makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained.

**Engulf.** The tunnel shambler moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter Large or smaller creatures' spaces. Whenever the shambler enters a creature's space, the creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the shambler. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.

On a failed save, the shambler enters the creature's space, and the creature takes 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can't breathe, is restrained, and takes 27 (6d8) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of the shambler's turns. When the shambler moves, the engulfed creature moves with it.

An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 16 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the shambler.

**Collapse (1/Day).** The tunnel shambler causes the ceiling or walls to partially collapse. Each creature in a 20-foot radius centered on a point the shambler can see within 60 feet must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The area becomes difficult terrain.

### Tactics
Tunnel shamblers don't think tactically—they simply move toward vibrations and engulf anything in their path. They're most dangerous in confined spaces where Collapse can trap prey. They sometimes inadvertently block escape routes or seal passages.

## Encounter Notes

**Combining These Creatures:**
- Glyphspiders often alert other dungeon denizens to intruders
- Stone Whisperers and Void Crawlers sometimes form strange symbiotic hunting pairs
- Ruin Wraiths command lesser undead but avoid Tunnel Shamblers, which disrupt their territory
- Tunnel Shamblers are the great equalizer—they threaten everything, turning complex encounters into desperate escapes

**Thematic Use:**
These creatures represent different aspects of ruins:
- **Stone Whisperers**: The ruins trying to reclaim organic life
- **Void Crawlers**: The darkness that has grown hungry
- **Ruin Wraiths**: The past refusing to stay dead
- **Glyphspiders**: Ancient security still functioning
- **Tunnel Shamblers**: The slow, inevitable collapse of all things

**Scaling:**
- For weaker parties: Use 2-3 Glyphspiders or a single Stone Whisperer
- For mid-level parties: Void Crawler or Ruin Wraith encounters
- For strong parties: Tunnel Shambler with minions (Glyphspiders or Stone Whisperers)
