## Appearance & Physical Presence

At 6ft tall, Bazgar is average in size for an orcish male. He has a lean build, but with tight strong muscles and a grace to his movements that seems un-orcish to outsiders. His features are more delicate than most orcs, almost elflike, leading many both at home and abroad to underestimate him. This also makes him attractive.

Since he doesn't have the physique to inspire fear that his older brother has, he relies on his more unusual traits. He wears his hair asymmetrically, with it shaved to fuzz on the left side and a set of thick braids running down to his shoulders. He has a bird-skull earring on his pointed left ear and two obsidian studs in his right.

He wears a relatively light shirt of black iron chain with a red open vest of leather lined with rabbit fur, hempen trousers also lined with fur, a leather belt that is tied off with no buckle, and knee-high leather boots of rugged and durable make. His axe is bearded with a wicked curve and made of the same black iron as his chain. He also bears a shield, a wooden targe covered in stretched alligator leather with an alligator skull ringed by two spirit-flames painted in white on its face.

## Personality & Temperament

Bazgar is bold, defiant, and refuses to back down from challenges. He laughs in battle and approaches life with the belief that acting strong makes you strong. He values decisive action and commitment - once a choice is made, he doesn't look back. He has a strong sense of duty and honor, quick to defend his honor with violence if questioned.

However, caution is not his strong suit. He sees it as something for those without duty. He follows a code of blood vengeance ("Blood for blood, tusk for tusk") and is willing to give his life to defend spirit-places from desecrators. He holds deep contempt for gold, seeing it as a soft metal only good for bragging when you have nothing useful to offer.

Despite his moderate successes in training and early raids, Bazgar is constantly compared to his brother Ghorrak, and most find it impossible not to make that comparison unfavorably. This frustration drives much of his behavior. If he would close his mouth and stop insisting that the war is being fought the wrong way, he'd probably lead a normal life among the Dakmar'nak as an equal warrior.

## Voice & Manner of Speaking

Bazgar speaks with an accent, with broad intonation and rolling �r�s. His tone is typically upbeat and unserious, quick to make light of the situation. He uses a lot of animal-based expressions, such as �taking rabbit steps� to mean small incremental progress, or �karth-darg�, which means �alligator fucker� in his native language, and is his favorite insult. His vocabulary is moderately advanced, though he sometimes forgets words and has to reach for them.

## Background & History

### Early Life & Formative Years

Bazgar is the son of Bazrak (father) and Ad'kat (mother), who are rice farmers. This background sets him apart from typical warrior lineages. His parents are okay with their sons choosing the warrior path but not enthusiastic about it, as it's dangerous and they wish their sons weren't on the front lines of raids. However, they aren't controlling and let their sons follow their own destinies.

Bazgar's story isn't primarily about his relationship with his parents.

### Key Turning Points

**Living in Ghorrak's Shadow:**

Bazgar is the much-undershadowed younger brother of Ghorrak the First Striker, Chosen Warlord of the Rakthok Horde. His brother broke with family tradition to become a warrior and proved to be amazing at it. Bazgar tried to follow in his footsteps when he came of age.

Despite Bazgar's own moderate successes in training and his first raids, he could never possibly measure up to Ghorrak. This comparison is perhaps unfair, because Bazgar is only barely a young man and his brother has had 15 years of combat experience over him, but it remains true nevertheless.

It isn't because Bazgar is a poor fighter or strategist. It's not even because he doesn't match up to Ghorrak's might at that same age (though of course he doesn't). The real problem is that Bazgar is certain the war cannot be won the way it is currently fought, and he won't stop saying so.

**The Strategic Disagreement:**

Bazgar believes the enemy (the Calderon Imperium and the "Heart-Marked") is using the orcs as a source of recruits - they are gaining power from the battles, while the orcs are not. Moreover, they are not even wielding the power they're gaining; it goes to another purpose, one the orcs would be wise to learn.

He could never convince his brother. To Ghorrak, what matters is the war before him, not the motivations of the enemy or their dealings with the dead. The Ancestors fought the war in this way with the Spirits as their guide, and no one was to argue with that wisdom.

**Leaving Home:**

Bazgar, less devout than his brother, left his home and his tribe to seek answers and to build his strength and reputation. If Ghorrak is to be replaced by someone with a better plan, he needs to figure out that plan and become that someone. That's going to take incredible strength and skill - strength and skill he definitely does not yet possess.

But who knows, maybe he'll kill a dragon or rescue a sacred spirit-place and Ghorrak will finally acknowledge his strength.

### Recent History

Currently located in or near Ardenhaven (starting location), though his roots are in the Black Marsh.

## Goals, Drives & Motivations

### What They Want

- To make a name for himself in lands far from home
- To prove himself worthy, separate from his brother's shadow
- To gain the strength, skill, and reputation needed to become someone who can replace Ghorrak with a better strategy
- To have Ghorrak finally acknowledge his strength (perhaps by achieving a great feat of martial or spiritual strength)

### What Drives Them Forward

- Certainty that the war cannot be won the way it is currently fought
- Belief that the enemy's true purpose and power source must be understood
- The need to prove he is more than just "Ghorrak's little brother"
- Duty to his people and desire to save them through a better strategy

### Internal Conflicts

- Pride in his lineage ("I am Bazgar, son of Bazrak, brother of Ghorrak, of the Dakmar'nak!") vs. frustration at being overshadowed
- Devotion to his people vs. disagreement with their current strategy
- Less devout than his brother, willing to question ancestral wisdom
- Desire for recognition vs. being constantly underestimated due to his delicate features and far more famous older brother

## Relationships & Connections

### Party Members

TODO: Describe relationships with other PCs as they develop.

### Important NPCs & Connections

**Ghorrak Dakmar'nak (First Striker, Chosen Warlord):** Bazgar's older brother by 15 years. A legendary warrior who broke family tradition to become a fighter and proved exceptional at it. Ghorrak follows the ancestral way and refuses to question how the war is fought, believing the Spirits guide them. He does not acknowledge Bazgar's strategic concerns. Their relationship is strained by Bazgar's inability to measure up and his insistence on questioning strategy.

**Bazrak (father):** Rice farmer. Okay with his sons choosing the warrior path but not enthusiastic about the danger. Not controlling, lets his sons follow their own destinies.

**Ad'kat (mother):** Rice farmer. Similar stance to her husband regarding their sons' choices.

### Faction/Group Ties

**Rakthok Horde:** His people, whom he left to seek answers and build strength. He remains loyal to them but believes they need a new strategy.

**Dakmar'nak Tribe:** His specific tribal lineage within the Rakthok Horde.

**Calderon Imperium / "Heart-Marked":** The enemy. Bazgar believes they are using orcs as a source of recruits and channeling power gained from battles to some unknown purpose. He sees them as the primary threat that must be understood to be defeated.

## Skills & Capabilities (Narrative)

Bazgar is a skilled fighter with moderate success in training and early raids. He's competent as both a fighter and strategist, though he's still young and lacks the extensive combat experience of his brother. His lean, graceful build gives him an un-orcish fighting style that likely emphasizes speed and precision over raw power.

He uses an axe with a wicked curve made of black iron and carries a wooden targe shield covered in alligator leather, decorated with an alligator skull ringed by spirit-flames.

Bazgar prefers attacks that knock the opponent off guard or turn their strength and weight against them, such as leg-hooking trips and sudden charges with his shield or shoulder. He�s also skilled with his bare hands and has a penchant for pinning his opponents. Despite his finesse, he prefers brutal weapons like axes and warhammers. He fights with a shield because such weapons lack in defense, but prefers an open hand he can grab and distract with. He is quick to seize any battlefield advantages he can and is skilled at maneuvering himself, his allies, and his enemies into positions that give him and his group the edge.
