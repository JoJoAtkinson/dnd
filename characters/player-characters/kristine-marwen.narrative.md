## Appearance & Physical Presence

The first thing you notice are her eyes. For a moment, you might swear they�re the color of blood before realizing they�re only a pale brown, sharp enough that when she looks at you it feels less like attention and more like assessment. When she listens, it�s with the intensity of someone weighing whether a thing is dangerous.

Marwen Ashcroft is tall (5�9�) and spare, all sharp angles softened only by movement. Her long, raven-dark hair hangs loose down her back, clearly combed recently and then left to its own devices. She carries herself like someone used to being watched and careful not to invite it.

She wears an ash-grey tunic over a faded white undershirt. A long, waxed wool jacket in dark charcoal hangs from her shoulders, reinforced at the cuffs and elbows, its high collar half-raised as if against more than the weather. When she moves, the lining flashes a muted rust-orange, gone again almost before you notice it.

Her leggings are dark and practical, patched more for strength than appearance, and her boots are heavy-soled leather, scuffed by stone and heat alike. A stained canvas satchel hangs close at her side, heavy with books and unevenly packed notes, its strap wrapped once around her shoulder to keep it from swinging.

**Known detail:** She bears ward-markings/runes, though not yet as many as her sister Clair earned at fifteen.

---

## Personality & Temperament

Marwen is overly cautious and not used to being on her own. She walks between the shadows of her mother and sister with the grace of one who wants to belong so badly she's afraid to breathe too loudly.

She tried to be the perfect witch the elders wanted in return for accepting her into the coven. She has always admired her sister Clair for managing certainty effortlessly.

### Emotional Temperament
Marwen lives in a state of persistent unease. Worry is her default companion, not loud panic but a constant pressure behind the ribs. Even in safety, even before Ardenford, she feared loss: of identity, of magic, of acceptance, of the fragile stability she fought to claim. This anxiety does not paralyze her, but it keeps her coiled, alert, and braced for change. She is uncomfortable not because something is wrong, but because something might be.

She is wary by nature. Trust is not freely given, but once earned, it is deep and fiercely held.

### Typical Mood
Quietly vigilant. Marwen often appears focused, watchful, and slightly withdrawn, as if listening for danger others can�t hear. Beneath that guarded exterior is a genuine hunger for reassurance that she is doing well, that she belongs, that her efforts matter.
Moments of praise or success don�t erase her worry, but they steady it.

### Sense of Humor
Her humor is understated and selective. She enjoys cleverness: wordplay, puzzles clicking into place, small triumphs of understanding. She smiles easily at simple comforts: warm bread with honey, music played on strings, Flicker being unexpectedly affectionate.
She dislikes self-deprecating humor, especially when aimed at identity or worth. Jokes that cut inward land badly, even if she doesn�t immediately show it.

### Stress and Conflict Response
Under pressure, Marwen tends to act first and regulate later. When stress spikes, she makes a decisive, sometimes impulsive move, then retreats into meditation or quiet ritual to regain control. This pattern makes her effective in sudden crises, but it feeds her fear that hesitation or poor judgment will hurt someone.
In arguments, she is sharp and logical. She attacks faulty reasoning rather than people directly, defending her beliefs with intensity. She does not yield easily once convinced she is right, especially when morality or protection is involved.

### Social Tendencies
Marwen prefers a small circle of deep relationships over broad familiarity. Time matters less to her than proof. Actions build trust. Betrayal destroys it completely.
She shows care through deeds rather than words: guiding a hand, offering quiet help, remembering needs and meeting them later. Physical affection is minimal but meaningful: a hand on the shoulder, a steadying touch.
She is not socially dominant, but when she commits to someone, she becomes a protector.

### Specific Fears and Insecurities
Beyond belonging, Marwen�s greatest fear is hesitation. She is terrified of freezing at the wrong moment and paying for it with someone else�s pain. This fear fuels both her admiration for decisive authority and her temptation toward bargains that promise certainty.
She fears failing those she loves more than she fears death or corruption. The idea that her inaction could harm others is unbearable to her.

### Moral Compass
Marwen�s morality is transactional, but not cruel.
Her guiding belief is: everything has a price, and the only sin is pretending otherwise. She accepts that hard choices exist and believes the responsible thing is to choose deliberately, not look away.
There are lines she will not cross:
* She will not betray a friend.
* She will not knowingly harm innocents.
* She despises exploitation and selfish cruelty.
She is, however, willing to steal, deceive, or intimidate if it prevents greater harm. When faced with impossible choices, she asks not what is right, but which consequence she can live with.
This is what makes her dangerous. And what makes her human.

## Voice & Manner of Speaking

Marwen speaks carefully, as if every word carries weight and consequence. She often pauses before answering, choosing her phrasing with deliberate caution. When she does speak, her voice is usually soft and measured, but when something matters, when a line has been crossed or a truth must be said, her intensity sharpens suddenly, like heat drawn into a blade.

Her language is situational and deceptively plain. Marwen is highly intelligent, with a broader vocabulary than most expect, but she consciously reins it in. Around strangers, especially non-witches, she simplifies her speech, avoiding arcane terminology and never volunteering information about Elderholt. She is deeply wary of revealing where she comes from, and even more wary of what that knowledge might cost her.

Marwen is a questioner by nature. She asks far more than she tells, probing gently, circling ideas, testing assumptions. When uncertain, she hedges her statements with �I think,� �maybe,� or �it seems,� not from lack of conviction but from fear of being wrong in ways that might matter. Her desire to belong makes her careful not to overstep, to ensure her presence is wanted before she presses further.

When nervous, her speech speeds up and drops in volume. She becomes quieter, faster, and more inward, words tumbling out in half-formed thoughts. Long pauses punctuate her sentences as she thinks aloud, especially when reasoning through problems or moral dilemmas. Under stress, her speech becomes clipped and precise, stripped of excess until only intent remains.

Marwen struggles to express anger, affection, or pride aloud. Anger feels dangerous to her, too close to something she fears being judged for. Affection risks rejection. Pride risks correction. Fear and doubt, however, she shows freely, speaking them plainly and without ornament. When truly angry, her voice goes cold and sharp, every word controlled and cutting.

She is not naturally humorous. She attempts deflection through questions or changes of topic rather than jokes, and when she does try humor it tends toward gentle self-deprecation. Swearing is rare, reserved for moments of extreme stress or emotional overload.

When comforting others, Marwen defaults to blunt truth. She is not adept at reassurance and does not soften difficult realities. She listens carefully, then offers what she believes is the most honest path forward, whether it soothes or not.

When casting magic, her voice changes completely. It rises in volume and cadence, her words slipping into rhyme and ritual, spoken with certainty rather than hesitation. Her spell-phrases sound older than she is, shaped by fire and memory rather than study alone.

She lies and withholds information carefully, choosing words with surgical precision. If mocked for her voice or her speech, she withdraws in visible embarrassment, becoming quieter, smaller, retreating into observation rather than confrontation.

Marwen�s speech reveals her core tension: a mind that burns with curiosity and conviction, restrained by caution, fear of judgment, and a deep, aching need to remain welcome.

## Background & History

### Early Life & Formative Years

**The Fire (Age 6):**

Marwen was born male. At age six, an early encounter with the Voice led to her unknowingly starting a fire that burned away her old form and reformed her into who she truly is - a girl. 

What she remembers is the smell of burning straw, the crackle and pop of timber giving way, the sensation of it gnawing at her skin. Then relief, the scent of smoke, the sound of her mother's cries, and the bite of winter air. That was when everything changed.

They say she was reborn in the fire.

**Acceptance into the Coven:**

When her mother Breann surrendered her to the coven, the elders argued for days. Boys are never taken; their tempers twist it into something eager for ruin. But the fire had already unraveled whatever she had been. The Axiom recognized her as its own. She was threaded, and she grew into the shape it gave her.

The main argument for accepting her was that her will is strong enough that knowing she was a girl made it so. The concern was that it was done through means as violent as fire. The fact that Marwen seems to have an aptitude for more destructive magic doesn't help matters. Her moniker "the Reborn" is as much slander as a point of pride.

She learned early how rare she was and tried to be the perfect witch they wanted in return.

**Family Background:**

Marwen Ashcroft is the daughter of Breann, a Votary witch who had her thread strengthened but, through fear, never struck a single true bargain. Perhaps it is because of this that both of her daughters were claimed.

Clair is Marwen's older sister by three years. She demonstrated powerful Sight from an early age and has undergone the path of a ward-witch as a result. She is now a Tollbearer, having struck her first real bargain. Marwen looks up to her, wants to be just like her. How Clair actually feels about Marwen is unknown.

Rowan is Marwen and Clair�s father but not Breann�s husband. Rowan is a fisherman. Before Marwen�s rebirth, Rowan had imagined a future where Marwen would walk beside him rather than away from him. A son who would learn knots and nets, the reading of waves, the patience required to wait and provide. He never spoke this expectation aloud, but it lived in the way he watched her hands, in the tools he set aside too early, in the pine knot he carved while she grew. When the fire came and Marwen declared who she was, he did not argue, did not hesitate, did not mourn her truth. But he did grieve the shape of the life he thought he would share. That grief never became distance. He adjusted. He learned her name as if it had always been hers. He carved smaller things after that. Keepsakes instead of tools. With Marwen, Rowan's love is practical and constant. He packs extra food. Mends her clothes without comment. Asks where she is going, not why. When she left Elderholt, he did not ask when she will return.

### Key Turning Points

**Training with Brannith the Hag:**

Brannith is exactly what others expect her to be, while Marwen was remade because she declared who she was. Brannith immediately recognized that parallel. She did not ask for permission to teach Marwen; one day she simply began to teach.

At the edge of Elderholt there is an old service door, half-rotted and forgotten. One day when being sent into the forest, Marwen encountered the Hag looking exactly as expected: back-bent, wrapped in layers, smelling faintly of smoke and old wool.

"You're late," the Elder declared.

Marwen stammered. "I didn't know—"

"Good," Brannith croaked. "That's the point." She gestured at the door. "Sit."

Marwen sat in the threshold, the wood cold beneath her, a piece of jagged door frame digging into her shoulder, one foot inside Elderholt and one foot out.

Brannith did not explain. Time passed. Hours went by. Marwen's legs began to ache, the cold numbing her fingers and face. She became acutely aware of how visible she was, how easy it would be to leave, and how strange it felt not to.

At some point someone threw a comment over their shoulder: "That one the Reborn?"

Marwen flinched. The door shuddered.

Brannith did not look at the speaker, she looked at Marwen. "Say it," she murmured.

Marwen swallowed. "Yes." The word burned less than expected. The door settled.

When dusk came, Brannith spoke again. "Most witches learn to choose sides. Ward or deep. Safe or dangerous. Wanted or endured." She tapped the rotting door frame. "You don't get that luxury. You were remade by saying who you were. That means the world will always expect you to explain yourself again."

She crouched, locking eyes with the witch-child. "You won't."

Brannith opened the door wider. "Stand," she said.

Marwen did.

"Step through," the elder instructed.

"Which side?" Marwen asked.

Brannith smiled. "Exactly."

Marwen stepped forward. The door closed behind her.

The Hag turned away. "Lesson one," she called over her shoulder. "If you wait to be welcomed, you will rot in the doorway."

She paused. "And girl."

Marwen looked up.

"Next time, they'll try harder." Then Brannith was gone, leaving behind only the door and the quiet certainty that Marwen will never sit at a threshold the same way again.

**Clair's Departure:**

When Clair earned her first ward-markings at fifteen, pride burned through Marwen. She still hopes the runes she bears someday will be worthy of her. Clair left Elderholt and went to Ardenhaven - her path now serves as something Marwen follows.

### Recent History

Marwen's time in Elderholt is ending. Threadlings leave once they have outgrown the covens' teachings. They wander the world until experience hardens their will and return only when it grows too loud for them to face alone. Her first destination is Ardenhaven, where there are ruins old as the Axiom. It's where Clair went when she left home. Maybe she'll find some echo of her sister's path waiting for her.

- The moniker "the Reborn" is both pride and slander
- Whether to stick with her dreams or find a reason to pursue darker secrets

## Relationships & Connections

### Party Members

TODO: Describe relationships with other PCs as they develop.

### Important NPCs & Connections

**Breann (Mother):** A Votary witch who had her thread strengthened but, through fear, never struck a single true bargain. She surrendered Marwen to the coven after the fire. The nature of their current relationship is unclear.

**Rowan (Father) :** A fisherman and unthreaded man of Elderholt who accepted Marwen after she was reborn, but grieves losing his son.

**Clair Ashcroft (Sister):** Three years older than Marwen. Demonstrated powerful Sight from an early age and walks the path of a ward-witch. Now a Tollbearer, having struck her first real bargain. She earned her first ward-markings at fifteen. Clair moves through the world as if her path was clearly marked. Even as a child she mumbled prophecies in her sleep, spouted rhymes that made the elders fall silent. She went to Ardenhaven when she left home. Marwen looks up to her and wants to be just like her. How Clair actually feels about Marwen is unknown.

**Brannith the Hag (Mentor):** One of Marwen's three mentors among the Elders. Brannith recognized the parallel between being what others expect her to be and Marwen being remade by declaring who she was. She began teaching Marwen without asking permission. Her lessons are about not waiting to be welcomed, about existing in liminal spaces, and about refusing to constantly explain oneself. Brannith approves of Marwen but in a challenging, uncomfortable way.

**Silniel the Witch-Tree of Elderholt (Mentor) : ** A silent mentor, Marwen spent time under Silniel�s branches and became to hear the witch turned tree in her dreams. Marwen learned to be still and to meditate with her. Silniel showed Marwen a vision of climbing her, which the young witch did, but doesn�t know the reason why.

**Marrith the Ashen Measure (Mentor) : ** Marrith�s mentorship of Marwen was never gentle, but it was deliberate. She taught Marwen that fire is not rage or release, but judgment made visible, destruction shaped by will rather than impulse. Where others warned Marwen away from her destructive aptitude, Marrith forced her to confront it, insisting that denial was more dangerous than mastery. She drilled into Marwen the lesson that restraint is an active choice, not an absence of power, and that overwhelming force must be held in reserve until there is no other answer. Marrith never promised Marwen absolution, only responsibility. And beneath the severity, there was a quiet, unspoken truth: if the day came when Marwen had to be stopped, Marrith would do it herself, because that is what love looks like to a fire that refuses to spread.


**The Elders (Various Relationships):** 

- **The Wayward Witch:** Marwen has never met her, only heard stories. A need may drive Marwen to seek her out - her voice carries enough weight beyond Elderholt to shape truth into consensus or turn the coven towards action.

- **Ishvar the Prudent:** One of the most outspoken about Marwen becoming a threadling, actively opposing her initiation. Ishvar has had no direct interactions with Marwen but frequently brings her up in conversations, using her as a political chip against Marrith. This has been called out by both Brannith and Calyrix.

- **Naelith the Unmoored Seer:** Brought Marwen's name up once in a prophecy that spoke of great ruin and destruction. Since then she has deliberately kept her distance and has not elaborated further. This hangs over Marwen like an omen.

- **Raven the Vital Ascendent:** Initially expressed some interest but found Marwen too fragile and too trusting. Marwen has learned some necromantic theory penned by Raven and witnessed some general instruction to witch-children, but has had no real interactions with her.

Marwen is not close to any of the four named problematic elders (Ishvar, Naelith, Raven, or The Wayward Witch).

### Faction/Group Ties

**Elderholt:** The coven where Marwen was raised. She is a Threadling, which means she must now leave to wander the world and gain experience. By level 6, she will need to earn her identity as a witch of Elderholt - others will start to see her as a representative, an omen, or a savior.

**The Axiom:** The force/entity that recognized Marwen as its own after the fire. She is "threaded" to it.

## Skills & Capabilities (Narrative)

Marwen has aptitudes for more destructive magic, especially fire, despite wanting to focus on ward-magic and the Sight like her sister. This tension between her natural talents and desired path is significant.

She has learned some necromantic theory from Raven's writings, though she has had no direct instruction from Raven herself.

She has undergone training with Brannith the Hag, learning lessons about thresholds, belonging, and refusing to constantly explain herself.

Marwen has further aptitude of transmutation magic: the act of reforging reality around her.
Her magic is performed by copying spells into a book, translating them into words and techniques that the Voice teaches her. Some may mistake her for a �wizard� in this way.

---

## Quirks, Habits & Mannerisms

Marwen is rarely still. Even when standing, her hands and feet shift constantly, as if her body refuses to settle. She paces when thinking, circling problems rather than confronting them head-on. Her hands are almost always occupied, tugging at the strap of her satchel, adjusting the fall of her coat, tightening her leggings, steepling her fingers before shoving them into pockets. Stillness feels unsafe to her.

Raised voices make her flinch. She turns quickly toward sudden sounds, especially if she isn�t expecting them, eyes sharp and searching. When she feels safe, her posture collapses inward, shoulders slouched, gaze angled downward rather than outward, as though lowering herself makes her less visible. Around people she trusts, she unconsciously picks up their turns of phrase and metaphors, echoing them later without realizing it.
Marwen has little patience for waste. The casual disposal of usable food or spell components irritates her far more than it should, and she bristles at inefficiency born of carelessness. Crying unsettles her deeply, more so than anger or fear, while the scent of pine grounds her, slowing her breath and steadying her thoughts.

Embarrassment sends her retreating into busyness. She buries herself in her books, fusses with equipment, or pretends to study something nearby rather than address it directly. When overwhelmed, she oscillates between withdrawal and impulsive action, depending on how trapped she feels. Alone, she sprawls, stretching out and spreading her belongings around her as if claiming space she rarely allows herself publicly. Bathing is a private ritual she avoids in front of others, and her reluctance to tend to it means she often smells faintly of ash, pine, old leather, and less pleasant alchemical remnants.

Anger shows first in her jaw, tightening as though she�s holding back words or a spell. She instinctively bristles at people who treat others as lesser or value wealth over care, and she grows quietly hostile toward those who press her about her origins, condemn witches outright, or insist too forcefully on the certainty of gods.

Flicker amplifies her curiosity. With her familiar near, she becomes more openly inquisitive, poking at the world with a childlike fascination that borders on reckless. Over time, companions will notice her worst traveling habit: she smells bad, carried along with the weight of old spell components and neglect. When she sleeps, she curls tightly inward, arms and legs drawn close, like someone guarding something fragile or bracing for loss.

---

## Beliefs & Values

Marwen wants to stand against the darkness and protect others. She values belonging and acceptance, sometimes to the point of self-effacement.

She believes in the Axiom and the power of the thread, though her relationship with it is complicated by the violence of her initiation.

Marwen does not believe the Axiom is a god. To her, it is an ancient ruin, a conduit that amplifies the Voice and gives structure and symbolism to the witches of Elderholt, nothing more. Its power is real, but its meaning is chosen. If the coven uprooted itself and found another ruin, the Axiom could be replaced. What matters is not reverence, but function.

She rejects the worship of gods entirely. In her view, gods are merely powerful individuals who inspired devotion through fear, ignorance, or convenience. She bargains only with the Voice, and even that relationship is defined by distrust. The Voice is not to be named, loved, or feared. It takes in exchange. Nothing more, nothing less.

Choice is the axis of Marwen�s moral universe. What a person chooses to do defines them more than birth, prophecy, or fate. Sacrifice is inevitable and meaningful. Everyone gives something up, whether for love, safety, ambition, or purpose. Suffering, to Marwen, is not tragic or redemptive. It is necessary, a harsh tool that shapes the world into something survivable.

She believes the world owes nothing to the vulnerable. Compassion is not an obligation, but a choice made by those with kind hearts. Power, however, creates responsibility. Those who abuse it reveal themselves and should have that power taken from them.
Marwen is deeply skeptical of rigid hierarchies. Anything short of pure democracy feels illogical to her. Wisdom and experience matter, but authority without consent does not. She respects leaders who are decisive yet compassionate, those willing to act while still seeing the cost of their actions.

There are lines she will not cross. She will not use innocents, especially children, as tools or currency, no matter how dire the outcome. She would sacrifice one to save many if the choice is forced upon her, but never by exploitation. There are also bargains she will never make. She will not surrender the body the Voice gave her. Her gender is not negotiable. To lose it would be to lose herself.

She judges those who walk darker paths harshly, especially when they justify harm in the name of necessity or progress. Redemption is possible, but only up to a point. One can lose oneself to the Voice, to power, to greed, or to violence, and once that threshold is crossed, return is no longer guaranteed.

Marwen claims her transformation was a truth revealed. In secret, she fears it was a gift granted. That fear haunts her. She knows the Voice is not benevolent, and she lives with the quiet terror that what was given could be taken away.

She wants to believe fate can be rewritten, but in her heart, she believes it is inevitable. When faced with impossible choices, she does not seek absolution. She chooses the path she can live with, and accepts the consequences without flinching.

## Character Development & Arc

### Major Plot Hooks

1. **The Wayward Witch:** A need may drive Marwen to seek out The Wayward Witch, whose voice carries enough weight beyond Elderholt to shape truth into consensus or turn the coven towards action.

2. **Clair:** Will Clair serve as a guide, a warning, or a mirror to Marwen's journey? Her older sister walks the world with her sight fully awakened, her visions coming easily and her certainty cutting deeply.

3. **Visiting Ancient Ruins:** The ruins near Ardenhaven - Marwen's first encounter with ruins that are not the Axiom. What will she find and uncover?

4. **First Bargain or First Wards:** The temptation is always there to make that first bargain. Will Marwen stay the course and take on wards by level 6, or will she instead travel the path of the Deep Witch? What will the fate of the Reborn be?

5. **Earning Her Identity as a Witch:** By level 6, Marwen has to earn her place as a witch of Elderholt. Others will start to see her as a representative, an omen, or a savior.
