here a little story background idea for you, let me know if it fits

---

Fletcher never told you that he changed your last name. Legally. Quietly. He did it years ago, without discussion, without ceremony, without a word to you.

You found out by accident.

You were older by then, finally striking out on your own, filling out guild registries and paperwork that assumed you knew who you were. The clerk frowned, checked the records twice, then slid the form back across the table.
“That’s not your registered surname,” they said.

That was the moment it clicked.

Fletcher had done it long ago, when it mattered most. Not for pride. Not for control. For protection. To sever threads you never even knew were wrapped around your throat.

He never brought it up. Never asked if you’d noticed. Never explained himself.

But that was the first time you understood something important about him:
Fletcher does care. He just does it sideways, indirectly, and usually in a way that leaves you frustrated long before you’re grateful.

That’s the closest he ever comes to saying it out loud.
