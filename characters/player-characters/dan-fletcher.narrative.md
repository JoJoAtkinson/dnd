### Key Turning Points

**The Name Change:**

Fletcher changed the character's last name legally. Quietly. He did it years ago, without discussion, without ceremony, without a word.

The character found out by accident when they were older, striking out on their own, filling out guild registries and paperwork. A clerk frowned, checked the records twice, then said: "That's not your registered surname."

Fletcher had done it long ago when it mattered most. Not for pride. Not for control. For protection. To sever threads the character never even knew were wrapped around their throat.

He never brought it up. Never asked if they'd noticed. Never explained himself.

This was the first time the character understood something important about Fletcher: Fletcher does care. He just does it sideways, indirectly, and usually in a way that leaves them frustrated long before they're grateful. That's the closest he ever comes to saying it out loud.
