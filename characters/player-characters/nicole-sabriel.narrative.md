---

## Personality & Temperament

**Character Concept:** "What it's like to be God's favorite"

Include speech patterns (formal military bearing? defensive? humble now?), vocabulary level, favorite expressions, tone of voice, verbal quirks or habits, and how they express emotion through words. How does someone speak after years of being kept confined yet still favored?

## Background & History

### Early Life & Formative Years

Sabriel is called "the fourth descendant of a family line born and dedicated to our godly mother, Elaerith." One with such an exalted pedigree is expected to achieve great honors and deeds.

TODO: Describe their childhood, family relationships with the other three descendants, early training, and what shaped them before their appointment as General.

### Key Turning Points

**First Transgression - Appointment as General:**

Sabriel's first transgressions were faulty judgment and the tendency to err on the side of radical thoughts, eventually alienating half of their peers.

However, with Elaerith's mercy, a second chance was given by the Goddess herself. Sabriel was appointed General and charged with defending a city of lesser importance to Araethilion.

**The Fall - Loss of the City:**

Acting in their role as appointed general, after years of quiet duty, Sabriel grew restless. Seeking a clearer understanding of their security and early warning of any threat, they ordered scouts into the forbidden lands. On occasion, they accompanied the scouts themselves to see those outer realms firsthand.

The loss of the city serves as further testament to those who would voice opinion against Sabriel. It was a fall from great heights at great velocity.

## Relationships & Connections

### Party Members

TODO: Describe relationships with other PCs as they develop. Sabriel seeks companions who don't know their past.

### Important NPCs & Connections

**Elaerith (Godly Mother):** The goddess to whom Sabriel's family line is dedicated. Elaerith has shown Sabriel mercy repeatedly - giving a second chance after their first transgressions, keeping them close even after the city fell, and now sending them back into the world. Her reasons for continuing to favor Sabriel have never been shared. The nature of their relationship is complex - divine parent, patron deity, and source of both opportunity and confinement.

**The Family Line:** Sabriel is the fourth descendant of a line dedicated to Elaerith. TODO: Who are the other three descendants? What is their relationship with Sabriel? Do they resent the continued favor shown to someone who has failed?

**Former Peers:** Half of Sabriel's peers were alienated by their radical thoughts and faulty judgment. TODO: Are any of these relationships salvageable, or do they represent burned bridges?

### Faction/Group Ties

**Araethilion:** The elven realm/society Sabriel comes from. 

**The Forbidden Lands:** Sabriel ordered scouts into these lands and went there themselves. TODO: What are these lands? What did they find there? Did what they found contribute to the city's fall?

## Skills & Capabilities (Narrative)

Sabriel was appointed General, indicating military leadership, strategic thinking, and likely combat capability. Their decision to personally accompany scouts suggests they are capable in field operations, not just command.

They have experience with security assessment, early warning systems, and defensive strategy.

Their "radical thoughts" suggest unconventional strategic thinking, which may be either a strength or a dangerous tendency depending on application.

TODO: Describe specific combat abilities, magical capabilities if any, tactical expertise, and how these skills reflect who they are as a person after 2000 years of life and their time in confinement.

---

## Quirks, Habits & Mannerisms

TODO: Describe physical mannerisms (do they still carry themselves like a general?), behavioral habits (from years of confinement?), pet peeves, triggers (mentions of the lost city? questions about Elaerith's favor?), comfort behaviors, and distinctive quirks that make this ancient elf feel real.

---

## Beliefs & Values

Sabriel values understanding threats and taking proactive measures (ordering scouts into forbidden lands for early warning). They are willing to take risks and make unconventional decisions, even when this has backfired catastrophically.

They maintain devotion to Elaerith despite not understanding why she continues to favor them.

TODO: Expand on their worldview after 2000 years, religious beliefs beyond devotion to Elaerith, political or social beliefs (what made their thoughts "radical"?), what lines they won't cross now after their failures, and how their experiences shape their decisions. Have they become more cautious, or does the restlessness still drive them?
