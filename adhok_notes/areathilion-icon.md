Flowers have a lot of contradictory meanings, but I found a few associations that I think will work. 


Dandelion "Faithfullness" - 1. Field Devotees: Farmers, artisans, soldiers who attend seasonal rites.

Daisy "Joy" - 2. Chorus Offerers: Lead hymns, maintain local shrines.

Gardenia "Good Luck" - 3. Petal Acolytes: Novices permitted inside the outer temple gardens.

Allium "Unity" - 4. Dawn Cantors: Liturgical specialists who guide regional ceremonies.

Cress "Stability" - 5. Verdant Stewards: Administrators overseeing ceremony logistics.

Moonflower "Dreaming" - 6. Moon Veil Clergy: Trusted messengers who carry Elaerith's blessings—relics,
edicts, and prepared rites.

Coltsfoot "Justice" - 7. Radiant Custodians: (Paladins & War Clerics) Guardians of Elaerith's palace
approaches.

Poppy "Time" - 8. Inner Court Seraphs: Advisors who spend decades within the twilight hals.

Magnolia "Nobility" - 9. Divinely Touched: (Clerics) Personal conduits; beauty unnerving even among
elves, lifespans that blur into milennia.


and as a personal note, Sabriel's signature flower is the Lotus "Estranged Love" 


by default, Sabriel will wear robes with a daisy symbol to travel. but will keep the Moonflower and Magnolia in reserve. how they got all these robes has more to do with their smuggled escape from the tower and region. taking advantage of access to trade cloth. Sabriel has been specializing in weavers tools for this opportunity and likely made their own robes as a hobby.
