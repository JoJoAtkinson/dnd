The elves dwell in a mountainous region—not in the high, knife-edged peaks, but at elevations above most settled lands. Their forests are dense with immense hardwoods, trees of truly fantastic scale.

Elven cities are shaped with the mountains rather than carved from them. Stone, soil, and slope are incorporated into terraces, halls, and towers, but the mountains themselves are not hollowed out. This is no dwarven delving; the land remains whole, bent gently to elven will.

The capital is unmistakable from afar, marked by a vast tower that rises where forest meets stone. Its lower reaches are partially carved into the mountainside, anchoring it to the land, but its form does not follow traditional elven design. The tower is Elaerith’s. Its architecture is therefore regarded as godly rather than elven—an expression of her authority made manifest.

Elaerith herself is elven. The distinction is not one of origin, but of elevation.

This mountain is not the same that holds the dwarven mines, nor is it mistaken for one. The elves have their heights; the dwarves, their depths.
