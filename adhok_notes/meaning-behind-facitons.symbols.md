# Meaning Behind Faction Symbols

## Araethilion — Veiled Crown Theocracy
A nine-petaled flower, each petal a different shade, with a hollow center. Outsiders say you’d have to ask an elf of those lands to learn what it truly means—and Araethilion’s people so rarely leave that, to most, they’re half-myth.

## Ardenhaven — The Haven Realm
Born into power during the Age of Roads, and the only faction that truly spans both continents. Blue is said to honor the sea and the rivers that connect their towns and carry their people home.

## Calderon Imperium — The Ashen Empire
Coal fuels their economy, and war engines turn that fuel into blades and machines. Their symbol is meant to frame imperial administration as the “correct” answer to protecting the masses: order, enforced.

## Dulgarum — The Oathbound Holds
Royal, solitary, and inward-looking. Outsiders say the Holds want nothing but to be left alone with their mines—and that every “treaty” is really just a wall with better manners.

## Elderholt — The Coven Realm
The tree-goddess empower the witches of Elderholt—an old faith wrapped in older wards. The mark is also tied to the **Wayward Witch**, a lone wanderer in roadside stories who wears the symbol openly; she’s known across the lands by rumor more than sight, and outsiders often mistake her legend for the place itself.

## Garhammar Trade League — The Free Guild-League
Contracts and workforce—commerce as creed. Unlike their dwarven brethren, the League wants to be part of the wider world, always seeking more deals, more hands, and more leverage for their mines.

They’re famed for **rhodonite**, a forge-stone used in alloy work that produces some of the finest steel in the region: rhodonite steel.

## Garrok Confederation — Western Orc Confederation
As outsiders tell it: a shield for strength, and an eye for understanding—proof (they claim) that the Garrok are not only strong, but watchful, and capable of being reasoned with.

## Merrowgate — The City of Bargains
“Fair trade,” according to the Nine Guilds that run the city-state—and fair, in Merrowgate, often means “well-written.”

## Rakthok Horde — Eastern Orc Horde
Axes to represent might. Royal purple—said to be brewed from bog-snails—marks wealth and rank, a dye once prized across the world and now rare enough to feel like a legend.
